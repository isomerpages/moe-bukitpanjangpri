the school and former students, ten former students came forward to form
the BPPS Alumni Association. The Association was officially recognised
by the Registry of Societies on 28&nbsp;May 1998.</p>
<h4><strong>&nbsp;Objectives of Alumni</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;Based on the constitution, the objectives of the alumni are:
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To forge school ties and community
involvement between Bukit Panjang Primary School and its former students
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide members with the
opportunities of helping to develop the school for the &nbsp;benefit of
their children
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To encourage volunteerism
among members
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For members, as a fraternity,
to offer, provide and contribute expertise and resources</p>
