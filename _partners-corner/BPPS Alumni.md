In order to forge better school ties and community development between the school and former pupils, ten of our former pupils came forward to form the Alumni Association. The Association was officially recognised by the Registry of Societies on 28th May 1998.

  

Three of the key positions held by the founding members are:

*   President – Dr Jarmil Singh (Deputy Chairman, CAAS and Medical Director of ST Medical Services Pte Ltd)
*   Secretary – Mr Suparman Adam (Principal, Bukit Batok Secondary School)
*   Treasurer – Mr Mark Soo Pin (HOD – Science, Bukit Panjang Primary School)

All former pupils who are 18 years and above can join by contacting either the Secretary or the Treasurer for the application forms.
