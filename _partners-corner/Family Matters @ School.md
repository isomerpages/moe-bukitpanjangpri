Family Matters@School is an initiative by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF). Our school has embarked on FamilyMatters@School to empower parents with the resources, knowledge and skills to build a strong and happy family. Parents can better connect with their children through participating in the various family education programmes and talks organised for them. Parents identified for Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P) can also receive individualized/group parenting guidance from a trained family coach. We will also share updates on the Family Life Education via In Touch and/PG.
