Our Vision
----------

To advocate that BPPS PSG and its framework is structured as a fun active supportive group that provides accessibility to all parents through support of events and workshops that creates memorable and holistic experiences to all students, teachers and parents.

  

Our Mission
-----------

It is not a destination but a continuous journey where parents forge stronger bonds with their children and teachers through the school, and establishing new friendships with fellow parents to make the school a safe place for our children to learn in, making school life more vibrant and caring.

A Kampong … brings thoughts of a large interwoven ‘family’ that has got each other’s back. That is exactly what the BPPS PSG is.

  

We currently have over 300 members from all walks of life who take time off their day to help with events the school needs help with.

  

This can be anywhere from manning booths, conducting experiments to even drawing on henna decorations.

  

Participating and helping out at the stations during sports events is another avenue to help in.

  

Alas, it does not stop there, we also bring our own unique experiences to enhance the students’ learning. Some in the medical field can share their expertise while those who can cook a mean Briyani can share the knowledge of their secret recipe. The opportunities are endless.

  

One of the cornerstones of PSG is bonding. Essentially, we are a large fraternity of parents whose primary purpose is to help other parents and through our various bonding activities like terrarium building and tile painting, this bond is what we aim to foster.

  

Even if you are a working parent who might not be able to volunteer your time, we still encourage you to join us and keep in touch with what we do. This way if you find an activity or task that you are able to help out in, even years from now, you will be kept in the loop.

  

One of the aspects that PSG members have always appreciated is that we tend to be the bridge between the parents and the school.

  

We can take concerns and feedback from friends or parents from your child’s class and bring it up to the school. At the same time, we can help explain the school’s rationale on carrying out some of the activities to our friends and fellow parents as well.

  

As the old adage goes, it takes a village to raise a child. Come join our village and help not your own children through their primary years but all the children at BPPS.
