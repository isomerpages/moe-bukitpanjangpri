<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Bukit Panjang Government School, established in 1932, was one of the few
primary schools in northern Singapore. The first enrollment of sixty students
was made possible through the staff’s persuasion and the help of Assemblyman
Mr. Goh Tong Liang. The school continued to grow under the leadership of
principals Mr. C.A. Peterson and Mr. Wee Loh Siew, with an increasing student
enrollment that led to the opening of the Bukit Panjang Government Afternoon
School in 1952.</p>
<p>During the 1960s, the school excelled in athletics, and in the 1970s,
academic excellence became a priority under the guidance of principal Mr.
Chen Yoon Chee. Mr. Chew Soi Tee took over in 1985 and continued the tradition
of high academic standards.</p>
<p>In 1990, the school relocated to a new building on Cashew Road to better
serve the residents of Bukit Panjang. Two years later, with 62 classes
and 2,256 students, the school celebrated its 60th anniversary with Mr.
Lee Yiok Seng, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for National Development
and Member of Parliament for Sembawang GRC, as Guest of Honour.</p>
<p>With the “Thinking Schools, Learning Nation” vision, the school emphasized
national education, creative thinking, collaborative learning, and ICT
literacy, receiving significant upgrades in 2002 under PRIME. In 2013,
the school received the niche status for i2Can Dance, and in 2014, completed
the PERI XP Upgrade with an Indoor Sports Hall and a 4-story extension
block that housed new music, LSP, and LSM rooms. It was also made wheel-chair
friendly.</p>
<p>The school became single-session in 2015, offering Critical &amp; Appreciative
Reading to Respond Empathetically (CAR²E) for Applied Learning Programme
(ALP) in 2021. Today, the school’s legacy continues with its annual newsletter
and commemorative anniversary magazines.</p>
<p>In 2022, the school celebrated its 90th anniversary amidst the Covid-19
pandemic. Bukit Panjang Primary School’s long history of growth and academic
excellence is a testament to the dedication of its staff and students over
the years.</p>
