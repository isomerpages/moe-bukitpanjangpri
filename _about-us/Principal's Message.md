<p>I am pleased to extend a warm welcome to all students, parents, guardians,
teachers, and staff as we commence another exciting year at Bukit Panjang
Primary School.</p>
<p>As we stride into 2024, it's important to reflect on our journey and celebrate
our successes. With great pride, I can share that our school has continued
to excel in both academic outcomes and holistic development.</p>
<p>In today's rapidly changing world, the importance of equipping our students
with the skills necessary for success cannot be overstated. Hence, alongside
our continued dedication to academic excellence, we have increasingly emphasized
the cultivation of 21st-century competencies (21CC) among our students.
These essential skills, including critical thinking, creativity, collaboration,
communication, and digital literacy, are vital for their future success
and fulfillment in an ever-evolving global landscape.</p>
<p>At Bukit Panjang Primary School, we are committed to cultivating not only
academic excellence but also strong character and values in our students.
Our vision of nurturing "Future Leaders, Concerned Citizens" remains at
the forefront of everything we do. Together, let us continue to work hand
in hand, guiding and empowering our students to become empathetic, responsible,
and resilient individuals who will make meaningful contributions to society.</p>
<p>As we embark on this new academic year, I am confident that with our collective
efforts and unwavering commitment, we will continue to inspire, educate,
and shape the future leaders of tomorrow.</p>
