<p><strong><u>Principal’s message</u></strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome back, everyone, and a warm welcome to parents of the 2026 P1 cohort
as we look forward to another exciting academic year. We are thrilled to
welcome our new Primary 1 parents to our growing school community. Together,
we can create a vibrant and warm environment that is essential for the
growth and development of our children as they navigate their educational
journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start, I would like to express our appreciation for the unwavering
support you have provided throughout 2025. Your collaboration with the
school and your active participation in various</p>
<p>activities have played a significant role in developing and nurturing
our students. The positive outcomes of our collective efforts are evident
in the impressive school results we achieved last</p>
<p>year, which showcase the hard work, determination, and dedication of our
students and teachers as they strive to help our children realise their
aspirations. This success, which we all</p>
<p>take pride in, would not have been possible without your active involvement
and continuous encouragement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we move forward into this new school year, we are eager to continue
fostering authentic and meaningful learning experiences for all our students.
In this regard, we will be organising Meet and-Greet sessions during Week
2 of this term. These sessions will provide an opportunity for us to share
more specific information about the curriculum and expectations for each
year level, as well as to foster deeper connections within our school community.
Taking your feedback into account, we will also be revising the format
of these sessions, with some levels being held via online platforms. Please
refer to the details sent with this issue of the In Touch newsletter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, to provide a conducive environment for our staff, we
have started renovation works for our General Office. The renovation works
are expected to be completed by February</p>
<p>2026. In the meantime, a temporary General Office has been set up in the
Living Room, near the lift on the left of the foyer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We firmly believe that by working together as partners in education, we
can create countless opportunities and enriching experiences for our children—opportunities
that will not only</p>
<p>enhance their learning but also their personal and social development.
Your partnership is invaluable to us, and we look forward to a fruitful
year ahead filled with collaboration, growth,</p>
<p>and shared successes that we can all celebrate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you once again for being an integral part of our school family.
Here's to a fantastic academic year ahead!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
