Bukit Panjang Primary School has just celebrated its 90th Anniversary on 18 November 2022. We are proud of the rich and long tradition and the many achievements over the years since the school started in 1932. The school has grown from strength to strength. Guided by a strong set of values, character building, excellence and an open mind, we have ensured that the students under our charge undergo a quality holistic education. 

  

As an educator, I firmly believe that all students can have the ability to learn, unlearn and relearn. Learning can take place at any time and any place. Thus, it is important to create spaces and opportunities for learning to happen and allowing our students the time and space to experience and reflect upon their learning. Learning is a life-long journey and so the students need to learn and want to take ownership of it.

  

Here at Bukit Panjang Primary School, character building and a wide range of experiences are what we provide in education outside of the academic domain. Many of our alumni have children in our school and so do many of our teachers and teachers from other schools which is a testimony to the continuing search for excellence and providing a wide range of experiences which students remember for life. 

  

I am happy to be appointed as the Principal of Bukit Panjang Primary School. Together with all staff, parents as well as the community, we will continue to prepare our students to be “Future Leaders, Concerned Citizens”.
