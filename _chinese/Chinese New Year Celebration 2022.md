We celebrated Chinese New Year with a special appearance of the God of Fortune and the long missed lion dance, specially performed by our students.

  

The tiger is a symbol of dignity and courage in ancient Chinese belief. As we ushered in the year of the Tiger on 1 February 2022, the students had much fun making various forms of arty crafts with Tiger as the theme for their class activities during the celebration on 31 January, the eve of Chinese New Year. Four of our talented students performed Cai Qing “采⻘”, a ritual to bring in good luck and fortune, in front of the General Office.

  

Another highlight was having, Mr Seelan, our principal, donning the costume of the 财 神 爷 ,the God of Fortune, together with our two young ‘lions’ accompanied by the recorded majestic sound of the drum, moved from class to class of all levels.

  

Along the way, Mr Seelan sent good wishes to the teachers and students who were elated upon discovering the God of Fortune was the principal. At the same time, he also gave out prizes to the upper primary classes which had won the Best Design Recycling Box and Best Classroom Decoration.

  

The celebration ended in high spirits!
