Mooted in 2011, this 2-week long event aims to create an immersive environment for the learning of mother tongue languages. During the two consecutive weeks, a wide range of activities were conducted.

  

Chinese Language students were treated to a variety of online quizzes and activities, and hands-on tasks to arouse their interest in Chinese culture and language.

  

Specifically, P1 to P3 students were exposed to several classic Tang Poetry masterpieces, after which they were given the opportunity to showcase their poetry recital skills through audio or video recording online.

  

On the other hand, P4 and P5 students learnt about the interesting stories behind common Chinese idioms, followed by an online quiz of guessing Chinese idioms from pictures.

  

P5 students also enjoyed an interesting hands-on session of learning Chinese idioms through comics drawing via Zoom.

  

All students from P1 to P5 were also encouraged to submit a video of themselves making a short speech in Chinese. The speech was either a self-introduction or an expression of gratitude to their loved ones.

  

Our students enjoyed these educational activities that make their learning of the Mother Tongue languages fun and authentic.
