BPPS pupils are exposed to a progressive and experiential Music education programme in Bukit Panjang Primary School. The music curriculum and enrichment programmes are designed to provide a holistic approach in the teaching and learning of music in alignment with the current MOE music syllabus. Through these programmes, students will achieve the six school values of Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Compassion and Gratitude, and the 21st CC outcomes. We aim to attain a vibrant music culture in the school.

  

The music curriculum focuses on cultivating pupil’s skills and knowledge through listening, creating and performing. Our music education philosophy embraces the belief that all children are musical and seeks to develop their expressive abilities to empower them to appreciate and participate in music. Students will be introduced to a wide range of genres to put them in touch with their heritage as well as deepen their understanding of the cultural diversity of music in Singapore and the world. Students learn how to play instruments such as the recorder, Chinese drum, kompang, angklung, and ukulele, etc.
