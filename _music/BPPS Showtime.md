BPPS Showtime is a non-competitive platform for pupils to showcase their diverse talents in the Aesthetics during recess. Through this platform, we aim to foster a vibrant Music performing culture in the school.

  

Students with strong musical abilities and artistic talents are strongly encouraged to participate in BPPS Showtime to showcase their talents. This provides ample opportunities for our students to be developed as confident and active contributors, who have a sense of belonging to the school. It also sparks in them a love and deeper sustained interest in the performing arts. This cultivates a life-long enjoyment and involvement in music. We want to create a supportive culture for students to develop their creative expression and communication.

  

Students are welcomed to showcase their singing, dancing, instrumental playing or any other unique talents as well. We have had many budding musicians and talented students who showcase their talents enthusiastically during the recess performances.
