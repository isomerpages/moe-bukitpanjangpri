In BPPS, pupils are given opportunities to appreciate music, theatre and dance performances through the Aesthetics learning journeys. The learning journeys aim to inspire and increase students’ awareness, as well as appreciation of the Arts through live performances in a professional setting. They also aim to cultivate a love for the Arts in pupils through music, theatre and dance appreciation.

  

Through the assembly programme, pupils will be able to experience mass participation in music-making and learning. They will also be able to know more about an appreciation for dance, which is in line with our school’s LLP (Learning for Life Programme). The assembly programme also aims to inculcate in pupils a love and appreciation for dance.
