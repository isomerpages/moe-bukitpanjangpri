As part of the schoolâ€™s programme to provide basic water confidence and personal water safety, we will be embarking on the SwimSafer 2.0 programme. Students will learn the essentials of water safety, survival and basic swimming skills.

  

Through the programme, students are assessed and coached according to their competency level. At the end of the programme, each child will be assessed on their swimming competencies and awarded the level based on their skills.

  

The programme covers 8 sessions and is conducted in public swimming pools when they become available again. All students are required to participate in the programme unless there are strong medical reasons for the child to be exempted.
