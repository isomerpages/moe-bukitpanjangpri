**Purpose of the programme**

*   To promote BPPS schoolâ€™s Core Values

*   To provide opportunities for students to participate in fun-filled activities under the new normal
*   To encourage participation regardless of sporting abilities

  

Our annual Bukit Panjang Sports Carnival provides the opportunity for students to compete and showcase the various motor skills they learnt in P.E. The carnival includes activities such as game stations, telematch relays and territorial games. To add on to the excitement, a Staff and Parent Support Group race is also held as part of the carnival. The whole school gathers at the parade square and along the corridors, roaring and cheering for the staff and parents, creating a euphoric and memorable experience for all.

  

Sports carnival is managed by our parent support group members and student sports leaders (SLs). Various roles were performed by them such as stations IC, queue marshals and station demonstrators. Many thanks to our parent support group, volunteers and sports leaders for their outstanding contribution for the carnivals.
