The First Aid Awareness Programme was started last year for the Primary 6 students as part of their post-PSLE activities. The objective of the programme is to equip our P6 cohort with basic first aid skills so that they can participate in programmes in their secondary schools safely and with confidence.

The students will learn basic bandaging and first aid skills taught by trained practitioners who have real world experiences. The 2 sessions are conducted over 2 weeks so that there course material is more easily assimilated by our students. The lessons are a mix of hands-on sessions and lecture segments with engaging videos incorporated. The activities are carried out under SMM and under a teacherâ€™s supervision at all times. Participants who complete both sessions are awarded a certificate of participation.
