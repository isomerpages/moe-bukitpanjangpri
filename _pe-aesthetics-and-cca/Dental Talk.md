**Purpose of the programme**

 

I.          To educate students on the importance of their oral health

II.         To educate students on ways to care for their teeth.

III.        To promote oral hygiene

 

The school dental talk is an annual programme conducted for the P1, P3 and P5 students.

At Primary 1, students will be introduced to the correct technique of brushing their teeth and gums. They will also learn the effects of dental plaque and how their dietary habits affect their oral health.

At Primary 3, students will be educated on the relationship between dental plaque and the presence of acid in their mouth as well as the effects of poor oral hygiene. An activity will be conducted by the dental therapist where students will apply a plaque disclosing toothpaste on their teeth which is used as a visual aid to help them identify areas where dental plaque is present. This helps them identify areas which require improvement in their brushing.

At Primary 5, students will be educated on the different stages of gum diseases as well as the causes and prevention of gum diseases. They will also learn the characteristics of healthy gums and unhealthy gums.

For all three levels, information for the correct brushing and flossing technique will be reinforced.
