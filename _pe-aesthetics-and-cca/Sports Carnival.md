Bukit Panjang Primary School Sports Carnival is one of our annual events which encourage students to participate in friendly competitive sports and games.

Various events focusing on speed, agility, endurance and power were organised for them. By participating in these events, our students are exposed to activities which enables them to showcase school, sportsmanship, and Olympics values.

It also provides opportunities for students to participate in inter-house competitions across the levels and promotes the importance of regular exercise and participation in sports and games as part of adopting a healthy lifestyle.

The sports carnival was managed by our parent support group members and student sports leaders (SLs). Various roles were performed by them such as stations IC, queue marshals and station demonstrators. A lot of effort was put in by the parent volunteers and sports leaders to ensure that the event was a fun and enjoyable one for all.
