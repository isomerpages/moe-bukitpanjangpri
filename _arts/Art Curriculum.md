Our Visual Art curriculum is designed to develop our students’ aesthetic sensitivity and critical thinking skills by engaging students in experiencing, creating and appreciating Art in different forms and media.

  

**We strive to achieve the objectives through the following approaches:**

*   Inquiry-based learning approach where we emphasise both the process and the final product.
*   Develop artistic vocabulary to enable them to give constructive feedback on artworks.
*   Student-centric lessons to boost confidence, curiosity and imagination through active class discussions and enjoyment in art making.
*   Create a broad-based exposure of different art forms through a variety of visual art programmes to engage students with different interests, needs and abilities.

  

Batik Painting

As part of the appreciation of different ethnicities, students learn to appreciate batik as a form of cultural heritage, explore traditional and contemporary batik design, and also learn the techniques of toning and blending.

  

Rangoli

Through learning the origin and history of Rangoli, students gain a better appreciation of this cultural heritage. They learn to create their own Rangoli pattern using traditional and digital mediums.

  

Digital Art

We harness the affordances of technology to spark our student’s curiosity and nurture their creativity using Procreate’s digital tools to explore and experiment new and alternative ways of creating Art.
