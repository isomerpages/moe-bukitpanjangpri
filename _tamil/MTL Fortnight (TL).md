In conjunction with MTL fortnight, the P1-P5 Tamil students took part in 2 different workshops to learn about different forms of Art. The activities were conducted to increase the students’ awareness of Indian Culture, promote the usage of Tamil language usage and enhance their creative thinking skills.

  

The students took part in the following Art workshops:-

  

**P1 - Clay Modelling Indian Utensils**

Students learnt about the different types of traditional Indian Utensils and made Models of them using Clay.

  

**P2 - Clay Lamp Painting**

Besides learning about the different types of clay lamps, students painted and decorated their own clay lamp.

  

**P3 - Warli Art**

Students learnt the origins of Warli Art, a form of tribal art mostly created by the tribal people. Students created their own art pieces on the cloth provided.

  

**P4 - Pongal Pot Painting**

Apart from learning about the different types of pots, students got to paint and decorate their own Pongal pot. Students also learnt how they could upcycle the used Pongal pots after the celebration.

  

**P5 - Indian Tile Painting**

Students learnt about painting on tile using Indian Motifs. This is an ancient Indian royal drawing technique.

  

Apart from Art workshops, the following workshops were also conducted for the students:

  

**Oyilaattam** \- P1 & P2 students danced to Indian traditional folk music with brightly colored cloth held by their fingers. They learnt about the importance of coordination and moving accordingly to the count of beats.

  

**Karakattam** \- P3 & P4 students balanced a karagam (a pot decorated with tinsels, ornaments and flowers with a plastic parrot forming a cone shape) and learnt simple steps as they danced to the traditional folk music.

  

**Tamil Engal Moochu** \- P5 students were engaged in an oratorical workshop. It was enriching as they learnt the essential skills needed for public speaking.
