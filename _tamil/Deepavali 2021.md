Deepavali, also known as the “Festival of Lights”, is a joyous occasion celebrated by Hindus across the world. BPPS's Deepavali celebration took place on Monday 8 November 2021.

  

Our students enjoyed a colourful and vibrant e-concert in the class. The e-concert comprised various segments, giving students an insight on why Deepavali is celebrated, how Deepavali is celebrated and what is done in preparation for the celebrations.

  

In line with the celebration, the Mother Tongue department teachers have risen up to the challenge. They either wrote the word “Deepavali” or said the greeting “Happy Deepavali” in Tamil. The challenge was also showcased in the e-concert.
