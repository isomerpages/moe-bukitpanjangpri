BPPS Infocomm Club aims to provide students with useful and updated ICT skills. With these skills, they are able to keep abreast of new technologies and its applications to perform meaningful tasks for the community. Programmes are designed to equip students not only in ICT skills but also to give them opportunities to take part in competitions to exhibit their talents and creativity. Through the process of preparation, they bond with their teammates and work collaboratively to innovate with commitment.

The focus for this year for the club is on photograph and video editing, game creation using SCRATCH program and programming of drones. All the students in the club are taught to edit photographs and videos to create collages. Our Primary 3 and 4 students will also go through training for beginners as well as take part in the intermediate level of game creation. Our Primary 5 and 6 students will delve into programming of drones to complete tasks assigned and synchronous movement of multiple drones.

These programmes are designed to be engaging and fun for our students to learn skills needed for them to cope better in the technological world.
