For the first semester of the year, the students focus on ways to reducing waste. After discussions and research on the importance of recycling paper, they are involved in two related hands-on activities; making paper seed balls and making recycled paper. Through making paper seed balls, students are able to appreciate how to reuse scrap paper. They also learn to appreciate the importance of reforestation in combating climate change.  
   
Club members will also participate in creating and decorating paper from the pulp of scrap papers. In line with Earth Week’s theme, “Animals”, there is a segment on the importance of saving trees, which provides habitats for wildlife. Club members will create an infographic, which illustrates the steps in making recycled paper from scrap papers. They will also write their environment pledges on the pieces of handmade recycled paper that they create, which will be put up for display.  
   
I addition, Club members will do their part to advocate the importance of reducing food wastage by researching on the topic and creating presentations to be presented over the Clean Plate Campaign.
