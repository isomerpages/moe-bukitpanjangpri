Our Hockey CCA aims to introduce our girls with the basic skills and knowledge of the game so as to lay a firm foundation for them to enjoy the sport throughout their lives. The girls are organised by their age groups and also their skill level. They are taught passing, dribbling and tackling skills. Basic-to-advance footwork practices are a vital part of every training session and so games are incorporated to build camaraderie and teamwork. Through the practices, drills and games, the players learn the values of respect, responsibility, compassion, integrity, resilience and teamwork.

From its humble beginnings, the squad has now grown to a significant number such that we are able to field a competitive team for every category of the National Hockey Championships. We look forward to the competition this year while working hard to improve in all aspects of our game.
