Football CCA aims to equip every player with basic football skills such as passing and dribbling. Progressively, football players train to develop advanced skills such as positioning, shooting and skill moves. Football also requires players to have strong characters. During training sessions and matches, players learn about respect, self-discipline, teamwork, compassion and respect. Through the experiences of this beautiful game, our players have a holistic development that emphasises on their physical, emotional and social well-being.Despite a lack of a proper playing field, our players give their best in every training session. In 2019, our Junior Boys team clinched 4thÂ position in SPSSC Football West Zone competition. In 2020, with the introduction of the new competition format, our Junior Boys team did well in the classification round and entered Tier 2 of the SPSSC Football national competition.

We look forward to competing in both the Senior and Junior tournaments while continuing to progress in football and build our reputation as a good team. BPPS Woosh!
