BPPS Basketball aims to develop students' skills in basketball, teach values and send deserving students to represent the school in competitions. Over the years, the CCA has consistently sent 4 teams – Junior Boys, Junior Girls, Senior Boys and Senior Girls for the SPSSC West Zone Primary Schools Basketball Championship. All the teams train hard in preparation for the rigour of the competitions. This is also to build resilience, inculcate positive values in them and improve interpersonal relationships. Over the years, all the teams have developed values such as self-confidence, respect and teamwork and have displayed them during tournaments and friendly matches. The Basketball Team will continue to strive hard in the coming years to achieve an even higher standard.
