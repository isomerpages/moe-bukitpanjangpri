Scouting is a movement for self-discovery and education in the principles of good citizenship for young children through the Scout Method.  In Bukit Panjang Primary School, both the boy scouts and girl scouts get to participate in various meaningful community projects like raising awareness of the need to take good care of pets, collecting pet food for SPCA as well as park cleaning in the neighborhood.

As the cub scouts progress through the years, they complete the prerequisite requirements and earn badges. Our scouts wear these badges proudly on their smart uniforms on Founder’s Day as well as during the annual march past. Cub scouts who show leadership potential are nominated for district camps as well as school based leadership programmes to further hone their abilities to lead.

Through all the various projects, camps and competitions carried out in school, the community and the district, the cub scouts learn to be concerned citizens and acquire the qualities to be future leaders, as part of our school vision.

These efforts of our cub scouts have been reaffirmed through receiving the Frank Cooper Sands (Gold) for five consecutive years. The unit will continue to strive for greater heights as we continue our mission of developing our students holistically in a vibrant and caring environment.
