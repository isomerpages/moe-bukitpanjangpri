In Bukit Panjang Primary School, Red Cross is one of the co-curricular activities (CCA) which aims to combine character-building, leadership, essential life-saving skills and blood donation knowledge and local community service in its curriculum. Included in the curriculum is the Red Cross ethos and service to humanity as a core focus.

Members visit Red Cross Home for the Disabled and other homes such as Sasco Evergreen. For this special year, we created cards and made a video for them to watch due to the current Covid-19 situation.

We engage in ‘Park Cleaning’ activities and actively take part in SPCA donation drives and many more. These allow them to be more aware of the needs of the society they live in and contribute back to the best of their ability.  

We want to bring the best out of our members and prepare them to be a leader in their families and community. This is in line with Ministry of Education’s (MOE) approach in developing the 21st Century competencies for young students, focusing on character and citizenship education.

We have been actively contributing to the society on a yearly basis and because of the dedication of the Red Cross teachers and members, our unit has been getting the gold award every year since we started our CCA!
