Background
----------

In BPPS, Wushu CCA aims to develop a student's skills in his perseverance, mental attitude and physical being. We also aim to instill the values of Respect, Responsibility, Compassion, Integrity, Resilience and Gratitude, our school values, and good and positive sportsmanship in our students. Practicing Wushu not only helps to encourage a healthy and active lifestyle, it also cultivates an appreciation in cultural arts.

  

Our school Wushu CCA has annually sent students to represent our school in National School competitions in the Junior Boys, Junior Girls, Senior Boys and Senior Girls categories. Our team also participates in our schoolâ€™s Chinese New Year celebrations and is also invited to perform in public venues.

  

Our school team has trained hard to prepare for the competitions and performance. Over the years, our students have developed into confident, respectful and resilient sportsmen. Our Wushu family will continue to inculcate positive attitudes in our students while striving hard to better ourselves.
