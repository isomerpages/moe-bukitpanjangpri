Background
----------

The roots of Badminton can be traced back to ancient Greece, China and India. Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games in 1972. Today, it is one of the top 5 racket sports in the World. It is also one of the most popular CCAs in our school.

  

Our CCA motto is ‘Play Fair with Flair’. It is important for our students to understand and practise the value of sportsmanship during training and competition.

  

Each year, our Senior Boys (P5/P6) and Junior Boys (P4/P5) Competition Team participate in the National School Games (Primary) Badminton Championships organised by the Singapore Primary School Sports Council.

  

Achievements/ Activities

The key objective is for them to pick up competition experience and use it to improve their playing skills. Below are our recent achievements.

We are very pleased to share with you that in 2021, our Senior Girls (P5) Competition Team participated in the National School Games in March after a long hiatus. The girls have gained valuable experience and they are looking forward to the competition in 2022.&nbsp;

We are also thankful to parents who have been very supportive of their child who is in the Badminton School Team. They have helped to balance their child’s love for Badminton and their academic obligations.
