<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Football CCA aims to equip every player with basic football skills such
as passing and dribbling. Progressively, football players train to develop
advanced skills such as positioning, shooting and skill moves. Football
also requires players to have strong characters.</p>
<h2>Achievements/ Activities</h2>
<p>During training sessions and matches, players learn about respect, self-discipline,
teamwork, compassion and respect. Through the experiences of this beautiful
game, our players have a holistic development that emphasises on their
physical, emotional and social well-being.
<br>
<br>In 2022, our Senior Boys reached the Quarterfinals of the SPSSC Football
West Zone Championships while our Junior Boys competed in Tier 1 of the
SPSSC Football National Championships.</p>
<p>We look forward to competing in both the Senior and Junior tournaments
while continuing to progress in football and build our reputation as a
good team. BPPS Woosh!</p>
