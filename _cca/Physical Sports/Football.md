Background
----------

Football CCA aims to equip every player with basic football skills such as passing and dribbling. Progressively, football players train to develop advanced skills such as positioning, shooting and skill moves. Football also requires players to have strong characters.

  

Achievements/ Activities
------------------------

During training sessions and matches, players learn about respect, self-discipline, teamwork, compassion and respect. Through the experiences of this beautiful game, our players have a holistic development that emphasises on their physical, emotional and social well-being. In 2022, our Senior Boys reached the Quarterfinals of the SPSSC Football West Zone Tournament. Our Junior Boys will be competing in the SPSSC Football National Tournament in July 2022.

  

We look forward to competing in both the Senior and Junior tournaments while continuing to progress in football and build our reputation as a good team. BPPS Woosh!
