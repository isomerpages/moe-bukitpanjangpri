Our Table Tennis CCA provides opportunities for the students to enjoy the sport and develop an interest in carrying on with playing table tennis even when they leave primary school. The students can participate and enjoy the sport regardless of their skill level.The CCA also aims to promote sportsmanship and team work among the students. Apart from table tennis techniques and skills, students have the opportunities to build integrity, resilience and perseverance. Through the training sessions, the values of commitment, responsibility and leadership are instilled in them. These values are essential for the students to develop personal effectiveness and grow their character. They also learn to build positive relationships with others. With strong social-emotional competencies, they will be more ready to face challenges in life beyond school.
