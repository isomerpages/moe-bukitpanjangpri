BPPS Indian Dance was established in 2014 and it aims to serve as a platform for dancers to develop aesthetically and showcase their talents as dancers. The dancers learn a repertoire of Indian dance genres such as Classical, Contemporary and Folk Dance. It is aimed not only to nurture students aesthetically but also to develop them as leaders who are self-disciplined. Dancers learn to be more resilient and adaptable as they adapt to the changes in routine, and this is more apparent with the Covid-19 situation, where lessons are also conducted through online sessions.

The Indian Dancers have also made the school proud. They participated in SYF competitions and have won the Distinction award in 2016, the highest accolade given. They have also performed in school-based events such as National Day, Deepavali and Achiever’s Day. To contribute back to the society, Indian Dance also participated in the Lion’s Charity Annual Dinner in 2019 to raise funds for the elderly. All this would only be possible with the full support rendered by parents, our dance instructor and our students.

This year, our focus will be performing at school-based events through pre-recorded performances. The dance focus is on folkish yodel, which originates from Southern India. The dancers dance and move to the melancholic songs that describe the everyday trials and tribulations of a simple villager’s life while masking the sadness with optimism through happy beats. Thus, it is an inclusive communal dance to raise the spirit of the people.
