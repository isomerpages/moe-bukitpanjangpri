BPPS Malay Dance CCA serves as a platform to provide opportunities for students to discover and develop their interest and passion for Malay traditional dance. During dance practices, students explore a variety of traditional dance techniques such as lenggang, inang and joget. Students learn to dance gracefully with accompanying props such as tudung saji, selendang and piring. Beyond dance techniques, our students also learn to be disciplined and resilient as they strive their best to put up each dance performance. Students from different levels learn to work together as a team thus promoting friendship and social integration.

In 2016 and 2018, our BPPS Malay dancers brought pride to the school as they clinched the highest accolade given in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) presentation, the Distinction Award. The Malay dancers also performed in various school-based events such as National Day, Hari Raya celebration and Achieversâ€™ Day.
