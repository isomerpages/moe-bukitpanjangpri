The choir is one of the performing arts group in Bukit Panjang Primary School. It has about 40 members who have chosen to join out of their love for singing.  

Choir members learn a variety of skills in the choir. They learn to pitch accurately and have a clear diction in singing. They also learn to actively listen to one another and harmonize as a group. They are also exposed to a wide repertoire of songs. The choir aims to nurture the students’ vocal talents so that they can reach their fullest potential in this area. Other than vocal skills, the choir also seeks to develop the students in the areas of discipline, confidence-building and character building. 

The choir has been performing in various school events such as Chinese New Year concert, National Day Celebration, P1 Orientation Concert and Achiever’s Day Concert.  Through exposure to such events, our choir hopes to contribute to a lifelong appreciation of the vocal music in the school community and to make singing a part of the school’s culture. The members would also like to share the joy of singing and to contribute to the community.  

In addition, the BPPS Choir has been actively participating in public performances regularly. The choir participated in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and Singapore International Choral Festival (SICF) recently. The choir also shows commitment and passion as seen in our regular performances at the Voices of Singapore Festival in the past two years and participating in numerous inter-school choir exchanges throughout the year.
