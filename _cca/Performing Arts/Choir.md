Background
----------

BPPS Choir provides a platform for passionate children who enjoys singing, to make music together as an ensemble. The choral programme is one of the co-curricular activities offered by the school. It has about 40 members who have chosen to join out of their love for singing.

  

Students learn to improve their musicianship through singing skills such as voice projection and pitching, and rhythmic sense through body percussion and rhythm games. They learn a variety of skills in the choir. They learn to pitch accurately and have a clear diction in singing. They also learn to actively listen to one another and harmonize as a group. They are also exposed to a wide repertoire of songs. The choir aims to nurture the students’ vocal talents so that they can reach their fullest potential in this area. Other than vocal skills, the choir also seeks to develop the students in the areas of discipline, confidence-building and character building.

The members would also like to share the joy of singing and to contribute to the community.
