<h2>Background</h2>
<p>BPPS Chinese Dance has been established since 1995. It comprises 2 classes,
the Elementary class and Intermediate class. New members will be attending
the Elementary class to learn basic Chinese dance movements and skills.
They are promoted to the Intermediate class once they have met the minimum
requirements to experience a higher level of dance technique and choreography.
In both classes, the training incorporates various types of dance movements,
including traditional and contemporary to cultivate a greater appreciation
of Dance. There is also focus on dance technique training as well as body
conditioning exercises (e.g stretching activities, acrobatic moves etc)
to develop flexibility and stamina.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through intensive but enjoyable dance lessons, BPPS Chinese Dance aims
to guide and hone our dancers in the pursuit of excellence in dance and
groom talents to contribute to Singaporeâ€™s growing Performing Arts community.</p>
<h2>Achievements/Activities</h2>
<p>BPPS Chinese Dance has been obtaining Distinction awards at every Singapore
Youth Festival Central Judging Competition ever since our 1st participation
in 2001. Besides taking part in external competitions such as the First
International Youth Chinese Dance Competition (Beijing 2011), the 6th International
Youth Chinese Dance Competition (Singapore 2016) and the 8th International
Dance Festival 2018, BPPS Chinese Dance also holds public performances
at Chinatown Chinese New Year Light-up Ceremony and Chinatown Mid-Autumn
