BPPS Chinese Dance has been established since 1995. It comprises of 2 classes, the Elementary class and Intermediate class.  New members will be attending the Elementary class to learn the basic Chinese dance movements and skills. They are promoted to Intermediate class once they have met the requirements of the Intermediate class to experience a higher level of dance technique and choreography. In both classes, the training incorporates various types of dance movements-classic and contemporary- to cultivate a greater appreciation of Dance.  There is also focus on dance technique training as well as body conditioning exercises to develop flexibility and stamina (e.g stretching activities, acrobatic moves). 

BPPS Chinese Dance has been clinching Distinction award at every Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging Competition since our 1st participation in 2001. Besides taking part in external competitions such as the First International Youth Chinese Dance Competition (Beijing 2011), the 6th International Youth Chinese Dance Competition (Singapore 2016) and the 8th International Dance Festival 2018, BPPS Chinese Dance also holds public performances at Chinatown Chinese New Year Light-up Ceremony and Chinatown Mid-Autumn Festival Light-up Ceremony on a yearly basis. New members are also given the chance to perform during school events, namely Chinese New Year celebration and National Day celebration.

Through intensive but enjoyable dance lessons, BPPS Mirage Dance Troupe (Chinese Dance) aims to guide and hone our dancers in the pursuit of excellence in dance and groom talents to contribute to Singapore’s growing Performing Arts community.
