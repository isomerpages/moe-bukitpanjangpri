Background
----------

The Bukit Panjang Primary School Concert Band has a long and vibrant history in the school. Through the years, the Concert Band strives to provide a musical learning environment for our students to excel in and enjoy music. We hope our students will develop a love for this art form and be armed with a lifelong skill and passion in music.

  

Objectives of BPPS Band:

*   Equip students with appropriate skills for band performance
*   Increase students’ musical ability through a structured band programme
*   Enable students to learn values of teamwork and discipline
*   Enjoy making music together

  

Programme/Achievements
----------------------

All members of the Concert Band undergo a formal music education at their start of the band journey in Primary 3. Band members commit to band practices twice a week, exploring and enhancing their understanding of music with our band instructors. Besides music techniques and skills, students also learn the important values of teamwork, perseverance, and discipline through band.

  

To develop students’ musicianship and performance skills, the Concert Band regularly takes part in performances such as the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP), school functions and public performances. The Concert Band obtained a Certificate of Accomplishment in the 2018 SYF AP. Members also have band exchanges with other primary and secondary school bands, providing them the opportunity to learn with their counterparts and to build friendships.
