<p>Festive Drums CCA group was established in 2010. The CCA group has always
been a small but highly-motivated group of students.</p>
<p>Drumming is fun and addictive, although training can be tough. Those who
stayed on eventually demonstrated resilience and discipline.</p>
<p>Festive Drums CCA has been invited to put up performances during the Chinese
New Year Concert, Mid-Autumn Festival and other festive events. Before
COVID-19 pandemic, we participated regularly in community events such as
Lion Befrienders’ Charity Dinner, National Day Observance Ceremony and
community drumming event “Celebration of Drums”.</p>
