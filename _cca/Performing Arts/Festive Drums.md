Festive Drums CCA group was established in 2010. The CCA group has always been a small but highly-motivated group of students.

  

Drumming is fun and addictive, although training can be tough. Those who stayed on eventually demonstrated resilience and discipline.

  

Festive Drums CCA has been invited to put up performances during the Chinese New Year Concert, Mid-Autumn Festival and other festive events. Before COVID-19 pandemic, we participated regularly in community events such as Lion Befrienders’ Charity Dinner, National Day Observance Ceremony and community drumming event “Celebration of Drums”.
