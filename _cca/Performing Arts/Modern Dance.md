BPPS Modern Dance CCA aims to provide a platform for aspiring dancers to nurture and showcase their aesthetic talents by providing opportunities for them to be involved in the choreography of the dance and perform in front of hundreds. It also instils school values and life skills which are essential for students to navigate the 21st century. Dancers learn to be responsible, disciplined and resilient as they balance their time attending dance sessions and also managing their schoolwork. Dance has taught our dancers to show respect to others and work well with one another regardless of their age and background.

The Modern Dancers have brought pride to our school, clinching many awards in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and other competitions. In SYF 2018 and 2016, we clinched the Distinction Award, the highest accolade given. They have performed in many school-based events during National Day, Primary 1 Orientation and Achievers’ Day. We also make a point to seize any opportunity to contribute back to society. In 2019, the dancers performed for the Lion’s Charity Annual Dinner to help raise funds for the elderly. This would not been possible without the full support from parents, dance instructors and our dancers who attended training sessions consistently.
