<h2>Background</h2>
<p>BPPS Modern Dance aims to provide a platform for aspiring dancers to nurture
and showcase their aesthetic talents by providing opportunities for them
to be involved in the choreography of the dance and perform in front of
hundreds. It also instills school values and life skills which are essential
for students to navigate the 21st century. Dancers learn to be responsible,
disciplined and resilient as they balance their time attending dance sessions
and managing their schoolwork. Dance has taught our dancers to show respect
to others and work well with one another regardless of their age and background.</p>
<h2>Achievements/ Activities</h2>
<p>The Modern Dance Group has grown strength to strength over the years.
Since its inception, the group has won awards in the Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF) and other competitions. In SYF 2016 and 2018, we achieved the Distinction
Award, which is the highest accolade given. The dancers have performed
in many school-based events such as National Day and Achievers’ Day. We
also make a point to contribute back to society by performing for a fund-raising
event for the Lion’s Charity. The dancers not only hone their skills and
talent in dancing, but important values like Respect, Responsibility and
Teamwork are also stressed upon during the training sessions.</p>
