Background
----------

Chinese painting is an ancient art that captures the world in deceptively simple strokes, yet manifests its complexity in mesmerizing beauty. Through subtle use of ink and water in different graduations: wet, dry etc., it strives to reflect the essence of nature, human beings and their relationship in a pure and harmonious fashion. Painting in the traditional style is known today in Chinese as guóhuà (国画), meaning "national" or "native painting". It involves essentially the same techniques as calligraphy and is done with a brush dipped in black ink or coloured pigments; oils are not used.
