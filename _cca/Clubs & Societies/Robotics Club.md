Being a new CCA, which embarked this year, Robotics Club started by inviting the Primary 3 students. With that, a group of 25 members started on a journey of robot building using Lego Spike Prime set which consists of colourful building elements, easy-to-use hardware, and an intuitive drag-and-drop coding language based on Scratch. Our members are continuously engaged through playful learning activities to think critically and solve complex problems, regardless of their learning level. From easy-entry projects to limitless creative design possibilities, Robotics Club members get to learn the essential STEAM and 21st century skills needed to become the innovative minds of tomorrow... while having fun!
