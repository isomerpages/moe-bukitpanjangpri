The focus for the club is on basic AVA manipulation, basic creation of collages and editing of videos, game creation using SCRATCH, Code Monkey, Minecraft in Education program and programming of drones. All the students in the club are taught basic skills to edit photographs and videos to create collages. Our Primary 3 and 4 students will also go through training for beginners as well as take part in the intermediate level of game creation. Our Primary 5 and 6 students will delve into programming of drones to complete tasks assigned and synchronous movement of multiple drones. They will also be thrown into a world of virtual Lego to create educational games.

  

These programmes are designed to be engaging and fun for our students to learn skills needed for them to cope better in the technological world.
