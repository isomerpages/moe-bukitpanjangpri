Background and Objectives
-------------------------

To promote sustainable living under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, BPPS aims to nurture concerned citizens who respect and care for the environment. BPPS’ motto, “Endeavour” serves as a reminder for all our students to put in their best efforts to promote sustainable living and to empower them to play their part towards sustainable living. Green habits take time to root in our society therefore it is important to work towards educating the students to be passionate in the environmental efforts and understanding the long term benefits of green habits.

  

To nurture future leaders and concerned citizens, we believe that every learner an adaptable and compassionate leader who is grounded in school values and has the heart to serve others.

  

_Objective:_

Through this programme, the school aims to:

*   To provide students with rich and positive learning experiences to nurture and develop respectful and responsible students who show compassion and gratitude towards others, while upholding integrity and staying resilient.

  

Tiered Approach
---------------

The school adopts a three tier approach in promoting eco-stewardship.

  

Tier 1 events aims to provide the students with knowledge and understanding. Every student will be provided with the opportunity to participate in the tier 1 events e.g. World Water Week, Earth week, Biodiversity week, etc to better understand the objectives of each of the event.

  

Tier 2 events will provide opportunities for the students as a level to embark on projects e.g. upcycling project for 5, Entrepenurial day for P5, which will allow them to show and practice what they have learnt via actions.

  

Tier 3 events will target a smaller group of students e.g. Green ambassadors and Environmental Science Club students. These events will allow them to carry out the 5 practices of exemplary leadership. They will internalise their learning and promote Environmental Education whenever possible.
