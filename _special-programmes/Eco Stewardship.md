<h2>Background and Objectives</h2>
<p>To promote sustainable living under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, BPPS
aims to nurture concerned citizens who respect and care for the environment.
BPPS’ motto, “Endeavour” serves as a reminder for all our students to put
in their best efforts to promote sustainable living and to empower them
to play their part towards sustainable living. Green habits take time to
root in our society therefore it is important to work towards educating
the students to be passionate in the environmental efforts and understanding
the long term benefits of green habits.</p>
<p><em>Mission: Developing our students holistically in a vibrant and caring environment</em>
</p>
<p>To nurture future leaders and concerned citizens, we believe that every
learner an adaptable and compassionate leader who is grounded in school
values and has the heart to serve others.</p>
<p><em>Objective:</em>
</p>
<p><em>The programmes will focus on the different school values at each level.</em>

<p>Through this programme, the school aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To provide students with rich and positive learning experiences to nurture
and develop respectful and responsible students who show compassion and
gratitude towards others, while upholding integrity and staying resilient.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tiered Approach</h2>
<p>The school adopts a three tier approach in promoting eco-stewardship.</p>
<p>Tier 1 events aims to provide the students with knowledge and understanding.
Every student will be provided with the opportunity to participate in the
tier 1 events e.g. World Water Week, Earth week, Biodiversity week, etc
to better understand the objectives of each of the event.</p>
<p>Tier 2 events will provide opportunities for the students as a level to
embark on projects e.g. upcycling project for 5, Entrepenurial day for
P5, which will allow them to show and practice what they have learnt via
actions.</p>
<p>Tier 3 events will target a smaller group of students e.g. Green ambassadors
and Environmental Science Club students. These events will allow them to
carry out the 5 practices of exemplary leadership. They will internalise
their learning and promote Environmental Education whenever possible.</p>
