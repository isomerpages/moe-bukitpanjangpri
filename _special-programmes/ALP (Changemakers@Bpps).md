<h2><strong>Applied Learning Programme: Changemakers@BPPS</strong> <strong>NEW!</strong></h2>
<p>We are excited to announce the launch of our new Applied Learning Programme
(ALP), Changemakers@BPPS. Starting in 2025, this programme aligns with
our school's vision of developing ‘Future Leaders, Concerned Citizens’
and our mission of providing a holistic education in a vibrant and caring
environment.</p>
<p>Changemakers@BPPS is a school-wide Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW)
designed to empower our students to become active contributors to society
by developing crucial 21<sup>st </sup>century competencies (21CC), with
an intentional focus on honing students’ communication and adaptive thinking
skills. The programme adopts the Design for Change (DFC) approach, which
encourages students to identify real-world problems, demonstrate empathy,
and develop actionable solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Approaches</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Talk Moves</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The programme leverages ‘Talk Moves’, as a key pedagogical approach to
enhance students’ communication skills. This approach encourages students
to engage in meaningful discussions, articulate their thoughts clearly,
and respond thoughtfully to their peers' ideas. Through structured conversation
techniques, students learn to elaborate on their thinking, listen actively,
consider various perspectives, and build on each other's contributions.</p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Intentional Development of Adaptive Thinking</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The ALP also places a strong emphasis on nurturing adaptive thinking skills.
Through carefully designed activities and challenges, students learn to:
<br>● assess different contexts and situations,
<br>● make connections between diverse ideas and concepts,
<br>● draw new insights from various sources of information, and
<br>● adjust their approaches when faced with changing circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;These skills are crucial in preparing our students for an ever-evolving
world, enabling them to navigate complex problems with flexibility and
creativity.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Desired Outcomes of Changemakers@BPPS</strong>
<br>Through Changemakers@BPPS, our students will:
<br>● foster empathy and social responsibility,
<br>● develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills,
<br>● enhance their communication abilities through structured dialogue techniques,
<br>● cultivate adaptive thinking to tackle diverse challenges, and
<br>● gain confidence in their ability to create positive change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We believe that this dynamic approach towards developing students’
21CC will guide them to become innovative thinkers and compassionate leaders
who are ready to overcome the challenges of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates on Changemakers@BPPS and the exciting projects
our students will be embarking on!</p>
