<h2><strong>Applied Learning Programme: Changemakers@BPPS</strong> <strong>NEW!</strong></h2>
<p>Our school decided on the use of rich texts as a launch pad into discussing
timeless human issues. With an underlying pedagogy of using Talk Moves
to create more dialogic classroom discussion — talk for learning between
teacher-student and student-student — the ALP aims to encourage empathetic
and collaborative communication as students read critically beyond comprehension.
It culminates in a capstone performance at the end of the programme where
students apply their learning ‘beyond the classroom’ by creating multimodal
texts, revolving around chosen themes, to inspire a wider audience.</p>

relevant to their lives and those around them.</p>
