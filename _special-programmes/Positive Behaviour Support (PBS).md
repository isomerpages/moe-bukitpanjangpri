PBS works towards achieving clearly defined student outcomes through a systemic approach based on scientific practices and sound data. It is a systemic approach for establishing social culture and individualized behavioural support through consistency in expectations, practice and education across the school.

  

With the PBS lens, we see misbehaviours as opportunities for learning by breaking down the functions of behaviour. It also hopes to actively teach values and behaviour to prevent behavioural issues among the students.
