Tiered Approach
---------------

The school adopts a pyramid approach in promoting the arts. Through this approach, the school aims to provide an experience for all students, identify and develop talents, and inspire students to continue to pursue their passions beyond their primary education.

Tier 2: Enrichment Programmes and Dance CCAs

Talents are identified and offered the opportunity to further develop and hone their skills through programmes planned at the second tier. Students in the Dance CCAs are also given the opportunities to participate. Programmes at this level focus on further exposure to the dance form, and dedicated training to strengthen students’ abilities.

  

Tier 3: Competitions and Performance – Going Beyond

Forming the highest tier are students who go beyond the school curriculum and enrichment programmes, to seek further opportunities to hone their talents and skills, creating for themselves another pathway to success.
