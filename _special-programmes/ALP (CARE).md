Applied Learning Programme - CAR2E
----------------------------------

Critical & Appreciative Reading to Respond Empathetically
---------------------------------------------------------

  

Our school decided on the use of rich texts as a launch pad into discussing timeless human issues. With an underlying pedagogy of using Talk Moves to create more dialogic classroom discussion — talk for learning between teacher-student and student-student — the ALP aims to encourage empathetic and collaborative communication as students read critically beyond comprehension. It culminates in a capstone performance at the end of the programme where students apply their learning ‘beyond the classroom’ by creating multimodal texts, revolving around chosen themes, to inspire a wider audience.
