The MTL Fortnight is an initiative by MOE to provide opportunities for schools to engage students in the learning and use of their mother tongue languages outside the context of their daily academic lessons.

  

In our school, we create an immersive environment for the learning of MTL and to provide platforms for students to actively learn MTL and the associated culture to experience MTL as ‘a living language’.

  

This year, our ML students were exposed to Wayang Kulit and Puppet-making during this year’s MTL Fortnight. Students did show and tell as well as dramatization using the Wayang Kulit and puppets that they made. Through these activities, we hope to enhance students’ oracy skills in Malay language and at the same time igniting students’ passion and interest in the Malay culture.

  

P1 & P2 (Puppet-making)
-----------------------

Students had the opportunity to do their part for the environment by upcycling while learning more about their mother tongue and culture. Students upcycled paper bags into their personalized hand puppets, and the proud puppet owners were eager to showcase their creations by role-play and show & tell.

  

P3 to P6 (Wayang Kulit)
-----------------------

Wayang kulit is a traditional form of puppet-shadow play originally found in the cultures of Java and Bali in Indonesia. In a wayang kulit performance, the puppet figures are rear-projected on a taut linen screen with a coconut-oil (or electric) light; in BPPS, students gave it a modern twist by using the whiteboard to project their hand-made puppets. Besides learning the history of wayang kulit, students had a unique experience trying out dramatization with their puppets too.
