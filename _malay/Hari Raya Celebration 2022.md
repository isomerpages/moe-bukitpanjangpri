After two years of online celebrations, students finally get to celebrate Hari Raya with a physical concert on Monday, 9 May, in the school hall.

  

As part of the programme for the concert, students learnt about how Malay traditional cookies were made. Students were also entertained by a Malay Dance performance put up by our Malay Dance CCA students.

  

The students had some fun trying to guess the mysterious teachers dressed in Malay traditional costumes too!

  

For the finale of the concert, our P1 Malay Language students put on a fashion parade to showcase their Malay traditional costumes.
