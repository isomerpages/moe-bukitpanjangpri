We sent 2 teams of pupils to take part in the Odyssey of the Mind Competition.

We are pleased to announce that our upper primary and lower primary teams managed to attain 2nd and 1st position respectively!

In addition, the upper primary team has been invited to **represent Singapore in the world finals** in the USA where more than 800 teams will pit themselves against one another! This is the **second** time BPPS has been invited to the world finals!

Our young ones have definitely done a great job and my fellow OM teachers-in-charge and I are indeed very proud of them! I am sure the kids have benefited and gained a lot of experience.
