Our school has embarked on the Moo-o programme for Primary 1 to 3 students this year. The students can discover the love and joy of reading through this platform both in school and at home. Moo-O helps students master their language skills, especially in the area of reading fluency and speaking skills. With its latest version, the Moo-O Learning Cycle now consists of various functions – Listen, Spell, Speak, Act and Tell - to better support the students in their learning.

The students had their first hands-on lesson with their teachers in Term 1 and then were encouraged to use it at home too. The department organized competitions that encouraged the students to record their own story with their friends and family every term.

This year, we also had a team of Primary 3 students taking part in a digital storytelling competition which was organized by the developers of Moo-o. They had put in a lot of effort and won a Merit award. Most importantly, they learnt the value of teamwork and had fun recording the story together.
