Understanding the importance between reading and writing, students are engaged in a series of activities to nurture their love for reading. Besides the reading activities planned as part of the library programme, students are encouraged to read widely through activities in the i-Re@d booklets. Other programmes such as “Moo-O”, an interactive application with a wide range of electronic books which are suitable for the lower primary, the upper primary students subscribe to the Little Red Dot newspaper that expose them to current affairs.
