**Readers’ Fest, Writers’ Fest & Let’s Talk**

  

To inculcate the love of English Language learning, students get the opportunity to participate in activities, beyond their English Language lessons, to nurture their interest in reading, extend their writing skills and showcase their oracy skills during the English Language Fortnight.

  

Readers’ Fest aims to provide a platform for students to share their love for reading with their peers. Activities such as “Characters Come Alive” allow students to dress up as their favourite book characters and share the book with their peers. Apart from sharing favourite books with peers, students also get to write their own versions of favourite stories by changing parts of selected stories. Through these activities, we hope to nurture the love for reading in our students.

  

Writers’ Fest and Let’s Talk are two other platforms which students get to extend and showcase their writing and oracy skills. During this period, students get to participate in activities such as poetry writing, publishing and sharing their writing on an online platform, and engaging in public speaking on selected topics. These activities allow students to explore and use language skills beyond classrooms.
