To inculcate the love of reading through exposure to different activities related to reading and to recognise that reading is fun through exposure to a range of genres, BPPS organised Readers’ Fest 2021. The event is in conjunction with World Book Day which fell on 23 April this year. As such, the whole week, starting from 19 to 23 April, was dedicated solely to this cause.

The highlight of the festival was “Characters Come Alive!” which was held on 22 April. Both students and teachers came to school dressed in costumes of their favourite storybook characters. They ranged from Elsa to Harry Potter and Luke Skywalker to Spiderman. The event was very well-received and everyone enjoyed themselves tremendously.

Students also participated in fringe activities. The Primary 1s and 2s wrote book reviews and decorated bookmarks. The Primary 3s and 4s designed book jackets and wrote about their favourite storybook character. The Primary 5s and 6s presented their views from the wolf’s perspective in stories such as “The Three Little Pigs” and “Little Red Riding Hood”. Readers’ Fest was a huge success as all the students were engaged in the world of books and the characters that bring the stories to life!
