**STrategies for English Language Teaching And Learning** 

Strategies at Lower Primary

**Shared Book Approach (SBA)**

There are two parts to the Shared Book Approach.

First, the teacher introduces and shares a Big Book with the pupils. In the second part, the teacher teaches language items, structures and skills explicitly, including concepts of print, phonics and grammar.

There is a range of follow-up activities such as drama and art and craft for teachers to select according to their children's learning needs.

	
**Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)**
	
In MLEA, there is a shared experience that is linked to the Big Book that has been read during Shared Reading. The shared experience provides the context and content for the children to think and talk about, using the target language structures and vocabulary they have been exposed to in SBA.

	
With the help of the teacher who transcribes the children's input, the pupils come up with a piece of class writing. This becomes the basis for group writing, when the children work in small groups, before they go on to individual writing.
	
	
The whole process is scaffolded for success and pupils also learn about cooperative learning as they work together in mixed-ability groups.
	

	
**Learning Centres (LC)**

The language skills learnt in both SBA and MLEA are reinforced in the Learning Centres (LC). In LC, activities are planned and differentiated for the pupils in three main learning centres – the Reading Centre, the Word Study Centre and the Listening Centre. Pupils have the opportunity to re-learn, revisit or extend what they have learnt at their own pace and in differentiated ability groups.
	

For each of these strategies, there will be a range of activities that will approach language both 'holistically' as well as in parts. Examples of holistic activities include shared reading, speech and drama. Opportunities to practise or study language in smaller parts are provided through direct instruction as well as targeted practice. This is where phonics, grammar, vocabulary, spelling and punctuation can be taught explicitly.There is weaving between 'whole' and 'parts' in the learning of English.

	
**Strategies at Upper Primary**

	
Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) is a regularly scheduled, fixed period of time in which everyone in the room including the teacher reads a book of his/her&nbsp;choice quietly and uninterrupted. This strategy provides pupils with authentic opportunities to enjoy reading while practising their silent reading skills.
	
**Supported Reading (SR)**
	

Supported Reading provides a bridge between teacher-supported reading aloud and independent silent reading. It provides opportunities for pupils to make predictions, read assigned section silently, discuss the text and difficult words as a whole class, led by the teacher. This strategy is usually carried out;for narrative and information texts.
	
**Know - Want to know - Learnt (KWL)**
	
	
Know - Want to know - Learnt is used mainly for non-fiction texts such as information reports. This strategy helps pupils to extract information and relate it to what they&nbsp; already know about the topic. Teachers guide pupils to organise, access and remember information. This enables&nbsp;pupils&nbsp;to understand and follow the logic of information presented in a text, recognise information that is repeated and distinguish between main ideas and details. The teacher’s support is gradually&nbsp;reduced as the pupils learn to be more independent in extracting information from what they read.
	
**Retelling (RT)**
	
Retelling is a reading comprehension strategy that engages pupils at different levels of language: from interpreting meaning at the whole text level, to individual words and phrases and back to the whole text again. It provides opportunities for pupils to engage in a whole range of important language and cognitive processes including recall of events/information, main points and characters, text structures and language features. It also provides opportunities for all of the major language skills to be applied- listening, reading and viewing as well as speaking, presenting and writing - as pupils actively make meaning of texts and share their understanding with their peers.
	
	
**Language Activities and Sentence Manipulation**
	
	
Oral and written activities will provide pupils with explicit instruction in oracy, word study, genre, grammar and language use at the various levels of language (word part, word, phrase, sentence, text, inter-textual).

**Writing Process Cycle (WPC)**

	
Building on the principles of the Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA) at the Lower Primary, WPC continues to provide pupils with guidance in the processes of planning, writing and reviewing before they apply these skills in writing, independently. At the Upper Primary, the focus is more on the creative aspects of writing and encouraging the voice of the young writer. 

Differentiated Instruction (DI)

Pupils are provided with differentiated support at various points of instruction to optimise their learning. Appropriate activities are designed to support, reinforce and extend their learning.
