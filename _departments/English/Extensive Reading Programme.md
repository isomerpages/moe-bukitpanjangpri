The Extensive Reading Programme was launched to inculcate the love for reading among our students.

To encourage all students to enjoy reading, teachers provided varied reading materials to students to encourage reading. Reading materials such as storybooks, magazines and newspapers are made accessible to all students to encourage our students to read widely.

Students who borrow many books from the library are also recognised. For top borrowers, they receive book prizes, certificates and “I Am An Avid Reader” collar pins. Classes that borrow the most number of books per term are also awarded certificates which are pinned up in class.

In addition, the library changes its thematic focus on a regular basis. There is a different focus every month. For example, “Amazing Animal Journeys”, “Science Fiction”, “The World of Harry Potter”, “What’s Cooking?” and the list goes on and on. This way, our students are continuously exposed to a multitude of genres.

There are also interesting programmes going on in the library. Students can participate in word searches, crossword puzzles and book scavenger hunts. They can also choose to design bookmarks or draw a character from a book they have just read.

In class, our students take part in fun activities that are related to reading. The “iRead Passport” provides students with a host of activities such as book reviews, character feeling charts, unscrambling of words associated with reading and many more.

Students are also encouraged to keep a record of the books they read in their “Reading Log”. They are then rewarded with stickers, bookmarks as well as a mystery gift when they have read fifty books!

With these activities, our students are greatly encouraged to inculcate the good habit of reading and to read extensively!
