Speak and Act is a programme planned for Primary 1 and 2 students to build their confidence in the use of English Language and creative thinking through drama, songs, poetry recitation and storytelling activities. In this programme, students get to experience the joy of expression through structured activities with focus on basic drama skills. Besides learning expression through body movements, students also get to broaden collaboration and communication skills through activities that build their confidence to perform in front of an audience.
