Scratch Moway Competition and National Code 4 Fun Competition

 “Coding and computational thinking are important skills for our children to pick up to help build Singapore into a Smart Nation”

~Minister for Communications and Information Dr Yaacob

 

 

Our pupils came on-board the Challenge@Lab (Scratch Moway Competition organised by IDA) and National Code 4 Fun Competition by Springfield Secondary School this year. The “Code for Fun” enrichment programme by IDA provides basic coding lessons to upper primary and lower secondary students where students learn to create animations and games using  a visual programming language such as Scratch (a syntax-free programming language) and robotic kits (e.g. Lego WeDo, MoWay).
