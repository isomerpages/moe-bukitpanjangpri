Flash Animation is one of the many post-PSLE activities lined up for the Primary 6 pupils. The pupils will create flash animations that would educate others. This is one of the ways the Primary 6 pupils are giving back to the school before they leave.

 

The pupils will choose the subject and the topic they wanted to work on (eg. Science, Pollination). Then they would come up with a story board on what their animation would be about. Once they complete their storyboarding, they can then create their animations.
