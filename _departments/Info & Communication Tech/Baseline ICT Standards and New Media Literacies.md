The Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies (NML) is a set of ICT and literacy skills that are infused into our curriculum. Our students are taught how to apply digital tools to locate and organise information (Curate). They also use digital creation tools and applications to create digital artefacts (Create). Finally, they learn how to use digital communication tools to communicate ideas with peers and share information (Connect).
