**Media Crew**

Media Crew sets a platform for the young and vibrant photography enthusiasts who get to learn the ropes of taking good photos and contribute to the school for many school events such as Racial Harmony Day and Chinese New Year. This year, a group of our novice photographers joined 5th National Photography Competition 2015 which was held on 21st April 2015. We are proud that they have shown great enthusiasm in learning from the facilitators and one of our pupils, Faith Teo Yi Ning, won a Merit award in the competition. We hope that our pupils’ interest in photography continues to grow.
  

**Reflections from pupils**

‘I enjoyed taking photos with my teammates and I have learnt a lot of new ways to take good photos with DSLR and other types of camera.’ – Nicholas, 6D

‘I have learnt photography skills and how to use a camera properly. The thing I like best about joining Media Crew is how photography has taught me to be more resilient and made me understand more about my interest.’ – Faith, Teo Yi Ning, 5G

‘I like to spend time here in training taking photos with my teachers and friends. At the same time, I get to learn different ways of taking photos using DSLR which is something that I do not have a chance doing it anywhere else except school.’ – Eunice, 3D

**AVA Monitors**

ICT will be used effectively to enhance learning and teaching in all curriculum areas, to support collaborative and co-operative learning, to develop higher order thinking skills and to help all students to realise their educational and social potential. The primary focus of the AVA group is on developing a support system for using ICT as a tool to improve teaching and learning across the whole curriculum.

 
All AVA monitors are students selected and trained from each class. And they will:

i. Assist teachers to set up projectors

ii. Assist teachers to set up visualizers

iii. Provide “first-aid” for PC start-up and access problems.
