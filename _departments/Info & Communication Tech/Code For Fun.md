Code for Fun is one of the programmes our Primary 6 students will be embarking on after PSLE. It is a 10-hour programme to develop an appreciation of the core computational thinking and coding concepts. It consists of 3 segments, Computational Thinking, Programming and Artificial Intelligence.

Computational Thinking is a problem-solving process that allows us to understand a problem and tell a computer the exact instructions to solve the problem. Students will learn to apply the four techniques of computational thinking which are Decomposition, Abstraction, Pattern Recognition and Algorithm design.

Programming is giving clear and specific instructions to a robot or computer. Students will learn to use block-based programming to program the Sphero, a robot ball, to light up in different colours, move around and draw shapes, repeat instructions using loops and react to events using sensors.

Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) is programming machines and computers to operate in a way that resembles human beings. Students will explore how A.I. uses data to learn and improve from experience without being programmed to do so.

The students will benefit greatly from this programme as the skills learnt will help them to cope better in the VUCA world that we live in.
