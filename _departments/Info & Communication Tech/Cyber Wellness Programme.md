Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself and other Internet users in cyberspace.
 

In BPPS, we aim to empower our students to become responsible digital learners. We adopt MOEâ€™s Cyber Wellness Framework in planning and implementing our CW curriculum. The three key processes of Sense, Think and Act highlight the stages that a student undergoes to prepare himself/herself to self-manage in cyberspace.

|Level | Theme | MOE Framework |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| P1   <br> P2  | Surf Safe Rules <br>A respectful message | Respect for self and others   |
|P3 <br> P4 | Stay safe in cyberworld <br> Screen Time| Safe and responsible use|
|P5<br>P6| Cyberbullying <br> Responsible Decision Making| Positive peer influence|
