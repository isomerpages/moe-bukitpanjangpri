<p>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users.
It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to
protect oneself and other Internet users in cyberspace.</p>
<p>In BPPS, we aim to empower our students to become responsible digital
learners. We adopt MOEâ€™s Cyber Wellness Framework in planning and implementing
our CW curriculum. The three key processes of Sense, Think and Act highlight
the stages that a student undergoes to prepare himself/herself to self-manage
in cyberspace.</p>

<p>Sense-Think-Act Process</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to share and reflect on CW issues with their peers.
For students with strong communication skills and leadership potential,
they may be selected as CW monitors and/or CW Ambassadors. These student
leaders serve as role models and advocates in sharing the messages of CW
with their peers.</p>
