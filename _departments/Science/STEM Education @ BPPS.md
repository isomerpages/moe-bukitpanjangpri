<p><strong>Target Group: Primary 3 and 4</strong>

<p><strong>Primary 3: Toy sailboat</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to fostering creativity and critical
thinking through STEM education, our Primary 3 students work together in
groups to construct a toy sailboat utilizing recycled materials. Students
explore various recyclable materials from home, such as plastic bottles,
cardboard, and analyze their properties and potential uses in their toy
sailboat construction. By using recycled materials, we aim to instill a
sense of responsibility towards the environment and highlight the importance
of sustainability to our students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the process of designing and building their sailboats, students
engage in problem-solving and experimentation, applying concepts related
to properties of materials. They work collaboratively in groups to design
and construct their sailboats, followed by testing their creations in water.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 3: Magnets at Play - A Student-Created STEM Toy Challenge</strong>
</p>
<p>STEM education nurtures critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration,
which are core 21st Century Competencies (21CC) outlined by MOE. At the
Primary 3 level, Science introduces the topic of magnets, providing a meaningful
platform for inquiry-based and applied learning.</p>
<p>To bring this to life, our Primary 3 students embarked on an exciting
challenge: to design and build a magnetic toy or game that incorporates
Mathematics concepts. This hands-on task not only strengthens their understanding
of magnet properties — such as attraction, repulsion, and the behaviour
of magnetic materials — but also enables them to apply Science knowledge
in creative and practical ways.</p>
<p>As part of the initiative, the students presented their creations to their
younger peers, who explored Mathematics in a fun and engaging manner through
the games. This experience encouraged the Primary 3 students to develop
their communication and presentation skills while serving as peer mentors,
creating authentic opportunities for learning and teaching.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 4: Blending Science and Storytelling - Shadow Theatre STEM Project</strong>
</p>
<p>This innovative project combines Science and the performing arts, bringing
together the principles of light and shadows with the expressive medium
of Readers Theatre. Primary 4&nbsp; students will design, build, and perform
shadow theatre plays for their Primary 3 juniors during English lessons
after WA3.</p>
<p>More than a performance, the project is an intentional cross-level learning
experience. It allows P3 students to be inspired by their seniors while
providing P4 students the opportunity to mentor, lead, and role-model.
This creates continuity in learning, as younger students are motivated
to carry on and improve the tradition when they reach P4.</p>
<p>The project offers an authentic platform for students to apply scientific
understanding of light travel and shadow formation in a creative, real-world
context. At the same time, it strengthens English fluency through expressive
reading and audience engagement. By collaborating in teams to design and
stage their performances, students also cultivate key 21st Century Competencies
(21CC) such as creativity, communication, collaboration, and self-directed
learning.</p>
<p>Through this unique integration of Science and storytelling, students
not only deepen their subject mastery but also build empathy, leadership,
and confidence, embodying our school’s vision of holistic and meaningful
learning.</p>
