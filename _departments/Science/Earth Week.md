Earth Week 2022: Care for Animals. Sustainable Horticulture.
------------------------------------------------------------

Our school celebrated Earth week from 18 to 22 April. Two events were planned for our students - Pets Day (Care for Animals) and Earth Day (Sustainable Horticulture). Through the planned events, students learned the importance of protecting the environment (Care for Animals) and taking action against climate change (Sustainable Horticulture).

  

Pets Day 2022 - Wednesday, 20 April
-----------------------------------

On this day, our student pet owners had the opportunity to bring their pets to school and share with their friends on how they cared for their pets at home. It was a rare opportunity for all animal lovers, students and teachers alike, to come together to marvel and share their love for animals.

Earth Day 2022 - Friday, 22 April
---------------------------------

After morning assembly, our students recited our Earth Day Pledge to pledge to do their part for Mother Earth. The little things that they pledged to do will make a collective difference to ensure our planet Earth can sustain mankind for many generations to come. It also showcases our schoolâ€™s commitment to educate our students to be concerned citizens of the World.

Recess Activity: Sustainable Horticulture and Writing of Personal Pledge
------------------------------------------------------------------------

During recess, our P1 to P6 students wrote their pledges on coloured paper. The Parents Support Group (PSG) members helped to put up the pledges onto the Pledge Tree. It is heartening to see our students making the effort to make their personal pledges to do their part for our planet Earth.

  

At the same time, students exchanged their personal pledges for a packet of seeds or seedlings to bring home. This is to give them the opportunity to grow their greens at home.

  

To make gardening even greener, we used sustainable horticulture techniques to grow edible greens in school. With the overwhelming support from our students, we managed to raise $190 for SPCA through the sale of the vegetables that were grown and harvested on our rooftop garden in school. We hope this helps to educate our students that growing our greens is a sustainable activity that everyone can easily take up at home.
