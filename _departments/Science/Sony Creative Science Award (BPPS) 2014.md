This year, we received a total of 117 toys from Primary 1 to 6 pupils. Primary 1 and 2 pupils went through a round of interview to determine the winners. During the interview, pupils were asked how they came up with the toys and how the toys work.

 

Primary 3 to 6 pupils who took part in the Sony Creative Science Award School Competition were given a booth each to display their toys and explain how their toys work. They articulated their thoughts and explained the scientific concept behind making the toys to win votes from their fellow school mates.

 

We hope that through the school competition, pupils will be given the opportunity to unleash their creativity and discover the inventor in him or her!
