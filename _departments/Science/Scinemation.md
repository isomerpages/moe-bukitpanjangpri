After the prize presentation, the pupils had fun at the carnival.

 

**Scinemation 2012** 

Four groups of pupils represented the school in Scinemation, Singaporeâ€™s only stop-motion animation competition, from 6 to 9 November at the Science Centre for the second year. One group, JED, comprising Lim Hong Yao (6L), Jason Teoh (6L) and Elias Tan (6L) did the school proud by clinching the championship! Each of them received a Wii, a medal and together $500 cash. Another group, DJS, comprising Saniya Nangia (5J), Dylan Ong (5I) and Joyce Ang (4H) won the best story award.

 

The pupils demonstrated great team-work as they worked on their 1-min stop-motion animation video, from scratch, using only the materials provided by the organiser.
