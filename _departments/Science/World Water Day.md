United Nations has officially identified World Water Day to be held annually on 22 March as a means of focusing attention on the importance of freshwater and advocating for the sustainable management of freshwater resources. This year, BPPS started the celebration of Singapore World Water Day on 22nd March 2021 with a video focusing on raising awareness of climate change’s impacts on water security in Singapore for P3 to P6 students while the P1 and P2 students were treated to an online story telling session with “The adventures of Water Wally and Sally”.

 

All students were invited to assess the Student Learning Space (SLS) for a range of resources and activities to learn about the different ways in which water benefits our lives, we can value water properly and safeguard it effectively for everyone. Tokens were  awarded to the lucky students who participated in the activities in each class.

 

Some of the P6 students had a firsthand experience setting up their own mini filtration system and learning about the importance of the system in obtaining clean water. Some of the P3 students created their very own mini rain garden to learn about conserving water.

The students had fun carrying out the activities and enjoyed the learning.
