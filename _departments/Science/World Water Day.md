Every March, we dedicate planned activities to celebrate Singapore World Water Day, to pledge our national commitment to spread the word on water conservation. The Environmental Science Club students kicked off the celebration by creating their own mini rain garden to learn about the uses of ground water.

  

In line with the World Water Day theme, the Environmental Science Club students shared with their peers on ground water – making the invisible visible and the impact of climate change. Climate change brings about rising sea level and extreme weather conditions which can jeopardise our water supply. A water rationing exercise was carried out in the canteen on 23 March 2022 with the support of our PSG to remind students the importance of conserving water. The staff also supported the event by wearing blue to commemorate World Water Day.

  

All the students were invited to learn more about the ways of conserving water via the exhibition at the canteen area and a range of different activities in the Student Learning Space (SLS). The learning package teaches them to make every drop count and to nurture water-saving habits from young. The rich learning was captured via the students’ reflections in the SLS package. Let us continue to remind the students of the different ways to conserve water in their daily lives to make every drop count.
