<p><strong>Target Group: Primary 4 and 5</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the Science E2K (Excellence 2000) Programme, the Primary 5
students from Resilience 5 and Resilience 6 embarked on an exciting inquiry-based
challenge â€” to design and build a wind-powered car using recycled materials.</p>
<p>Working in small groups, the students applied the principles of scientific
inquiry and the habits of mind nurtured through E2K, such as persistence,
precision, creativity, and collaboration. Each team brainstormed possible
designs, discussed the forces that would act on their cars, and experimented
with different materials and structures to improve speed and stability.</p>
<p>Through this hands-on project, students deepened their understanding of
energy conversion, forces, and motion and learnt how to frame hypotheses,
test variables fairly, and refine their prototypes based on observations.
The process was dynamic as the models were redesigned multiple times as
students evaluated their effectiveness, asked critical questions, and thought
of innovative solutions.</p>
<p>The culmination was a lively test run, where groups proudly showcased
their wind-powered cars in action. The activity fostered scientific curiosity
and resilience, while bringing about the joy of discovery as students saw
their creative ideas come to life.</p>
<p>This project reflects the essence of E2K, which involves stretching high-ability
learners through authentic, open-ended tasks that encourage them to inquire,
innovate, and collaborate.</p>
