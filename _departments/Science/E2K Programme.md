<p>E2K Programme</p>
<p>The E2K (Excellence 2000) Science Programme, an MOE enrichment initiative
for Primary 4 to 6 high-ability students, nurtures scientific inquiry skills
and 21st-century competencies through an inquiry-based, hands-on approach
adapted from Israel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Bukit Panjang Primary School, selected P4 and P5 students explore advanced
science concepts through E2K investigations. For instance, some P5 students
designed wind-powered cars using recycled materials, applying principles
of forces, motion, and energy conversion. Working collaboratively, they
hypothesized, tested, and refined their prototypes, demonstrating persistence,
creativity, and precision. The programme fosters critical thinking, scientific
curiosity, and resilience, while allowing students to experience the joy
of discovery through real-world scientific exploration.</p>
