**Science Camp 2014**

On 8th September 2014, during the one-week break, the Primary 3 and 4 pupils came back to school for a fun-filled Science Camp.



**Primary 3 Science Camp**

Similar to last year, the Primary 3 pupils got a chance to find out more about chromatography and also to find out how to make the plasticine float by changing its shape.
