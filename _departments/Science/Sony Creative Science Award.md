The Sony Creative Science Award or SCSA is a competition for primary school children in Singapore. The theme every year has been "Creative Toys".

In this competition, pupils are invited to use their imagination and creativity to make toys that demostrate scientific principles.

The aim of the SCSA is to develop and promote interest as well as creativity in science among primary school children in the country.

The contest is the only one of its kind in Singapore. About 3000 entries from 100 primary schools (about half of the primary schools in Singapore) are received each year, making this competition very popular with students.
