<p>The Sony Creative Science Award is an educational initiative designed
to inspire young minds in Singapore. This unique program encourages creativity
and innovation through the engaging process of toy-making.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The participants explore various scientific concepts to design and build
their own toys. This hands-on experience not only fosters curiosity about
the application of science in everyday life but also enhances problem-solving
skills and imagination. It is an exciting opportunity to blend science
with creativity and ignite a passion for learning in our children!&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>To spark creativity and inspire students from Primary 1 to Primary 4,
the Toy-Making programme @ BPPS is designed to encourage problem-solving
skills, hands-on learning, and foster scientific curiosity among our students.
It also instills essential values such as empathy and environmental responsibility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students are encouraged to think critically about how toys function. They
experiment with different materials that can be recycled, consider how
their toys can bring joy to others, and have the opportunity to modify
their creations based on feedback. This process of exploration not only
ignites their imagination but also nurtures their ability to innovate.</p>
