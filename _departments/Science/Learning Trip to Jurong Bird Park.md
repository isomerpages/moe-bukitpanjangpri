The Primary Six pupils went on a learning trip to the Jurong Bird Park for a day of fun - exploring the park and knowledge -learning about the different varieties of birds and their habitats in March this year.  This trip also ties in with the chapter on adaptations about birds and pupils had hands-on activities at the Bird Discovery Centre.  Moreover, they also enjoyed themselves tremendously at the bird shows where the birds performed various acts for the audience.  The day ended very well with pupils acknowledging that they have a better understanding of these feathery creatures.
