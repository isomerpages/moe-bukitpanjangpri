**Let your imagination take flight!**

Selected Primary 5 and Primary 6 pupils took part in the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition organised by Science Centre during the March Holidays.

These pupils had to design and fold paper planes to achieve the longest, farthest or most accurate flight. It was not an easy feat!
