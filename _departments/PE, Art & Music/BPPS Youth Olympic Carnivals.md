**BPPS Youth Olympic Carnivals**

 This annual affair of sports and physical activities is a culmination of many months of practices and more practices. Following in the footstep of the inaugural Youth Olympic Games held in Singapore in 2010, BPPS embarked on a similar journey, albeit with tinge of BPPS flavours. Held every year since then, this event always attracts former pupils to come back and help in the running of the event.  

Merging the values of the Youth Olympic Games of Excellence, Friendship and Respect with the school's own values of Respect, Responsibility, Life-long Learning and Teamwork, BYOC,  encourages pupils to be involved in sports and physical activities regardless of their background and capabilities. 

BYOC gives pupils the opportunity to be part of a mass sporting event where they can compete in a sports event amongst their peers. At the same time, this event gives opportunity to pupils who were not involved in the competitions organised by the Singapore Primary School Sports Council. 

**The meaning behind BYOC**

Dear Mr Lew,

For the past few years, BYOC for the Primary 5 and 6 levels have always been on the eve of the National Day Parade. This year’s event was no different, but the intensity of the game took another notch up for the pupils of BPPS. 

Since 2012, the Primary 5 and 6 pupils have been doing static activities such as high jump and basketball free throws, but this year’s format requires them to be part of a team that plays for the class and to challenge other classes.

The competition format requires them to be more competitive and is much more engaging and explosive. The vibrancy and the power to inspire took centre stage whenever the pupils put on their bibs as they formulate tactics and strategies to meet their foes. The challenges require us to play the BPPS-modified version of the Handball, Tchoukball and Captain Ball.

For majority of the pupils in the school, they do not have the opportunity to be involved in one form of sporting competition or the other. BYOC gave these groups of pupils to be part of a competition that allows them to compete in different sports and at the same time building their resilience as they overcome defeats and victories.

The finals of the BYOC for the Primary Six pupils were played on the 25th November where the four classes, 6H, 6I, 6J and 6K competed to grab the winner’s title. The eventual winner was 6J when they won with confidence and tactical know-how despite some stiff resistance from the other classes.

At the end of the day, the pupils acknowledged that, winning was not everything but the training and preparing for the competition were the main takeaways from this year’s BYOC.

Thank you for making my Primary 6 year more meaningful.

Your Sports Leader
