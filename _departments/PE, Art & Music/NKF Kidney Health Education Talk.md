**Purpose of the programme**

 

i.                       To educate about the importance of kidneys in the body’s ecosystem

ii.             To encourage students to practise healthy habits that will bring them lifelong benefits.

iii.            To promote participation in health-enhancing activities.

 

The Kidney Health Education Talk is part of NKF’s continuous effort to build a holistic programme for schools as they cover a broad range of health topics that not only educate on kidney disease but also on the overall well-being of one’s health.

 

Our students were taken through an interactive animated talk during the session where they were introduced to an interactive storyline and answered quizzes. This allows the students to actively participate as they were brought through topics such as:

1.    Wonders of our kidneys in our body’s ecosystem

2.    Consequences of kidney failure

3.    How to prevent kidney failure

 


Through this programme, the students were able to better understand the importance of a healthy lifestyle and be encouraged to practise healthy habits that will bring them lifelong benefits.
