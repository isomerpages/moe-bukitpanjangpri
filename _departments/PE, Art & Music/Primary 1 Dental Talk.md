Our Dental Therapist, Ms. Aqilah, conducted a talk for all classes in Primary 1. She demonstrated the correct techniques of brushing teeth and presented the students with an enjoyable animated cartoon video that focused on the importance of keeping the teeth clean and the ways to maintain good oral hygiene health.
