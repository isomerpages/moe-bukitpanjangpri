**Positive Behaviour Support (PBS)**


Positive Behavioral Support (PBS) is an evidence-based three tiered framework to improve daily staff practice positively affecting the student experience in school. PBS creates schools where all students succeed. PBS is a whole-school approach where we hope to create a school where the students, staff and parents feel good, think good and do good!

Positive Behaviour Support looks at creating tiered-support for the students to support their development. Children who require more support are given more support to enable them to achieve their best.

There are 5 key elements which drive the programmes in Student Development Team. They are Relationships, Recognition, Reflection, Role-modelling and Active Teaching & Learning of values and behaviour.

PBS also looks beyond just addressing behaviour but also to delve into the thinking and the emotions of our students.
