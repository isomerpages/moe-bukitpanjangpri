School Vision
-------------

Future Leaders, Concerned Citizens

  

We envision every student to be an adaptable learner and compassionate leader who is grounded in school values and has the heart to serve others.

  

We aim to provide students with rich and positive learning experiences to nurture and develop respectful and responsible students who show compassion and gratitude towards others, while upholding integrity and staying resilient.

  

School Mission
--------------

Developing our students holistically in a vibrant and caring environment

  

We aim to provide students with rich and positive learning experiences to nurture and develop respectful and responsible students who show compassion and gratitude towards others, while upholding integrity and staying resilient.

  

Student Leadership Framework
----------------------------

In line with the school’s vision to develop Future Leaders, the school aims to develop leadership qualities for all students in a tiered approach for all levels through CCE lessons, co-curriculum experiences, and leadership appointments.

  

In teaching of leadership skills, the school adopts the Servant Leadership Philosophy leading with the heart to serve and the 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership by Kouzes and Posner.

  

We aim to provide leadership opportunities for all students. Leadership can be learned in formal classes, co-curricular activities, school and community-based activities, as well as through experiential camps.

  

The school has three developmental stages, namely a ‘Leader in Me’, A Leader by Example’, and ‘A Leader at Service’.
