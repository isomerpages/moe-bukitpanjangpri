The goal of character development is to inculcate values and build competencies in our pupils to develop them to be good individuals and useful citizens. The school core values, namely Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Compassion and Gratitude are fundamental in nurturing good character. In line with CCE 2021, BPPS aims to develop in our students:

  

Good Character
--------------

Have a sound moral compass and a strong sense of right and wrong, think critically and ethically, be discerning in judgment, take responsibility for choices and actions, be caring towards others and strive for excellence;

  

Resilience and Social-Emotional Well-Being
------------------------------------------

Have a balanced sense of self, form healthy relationships, be resilient when faced with challenges, find meaning in life, and have a sense of gratitude and appreciation;

  

Future Readiness
----------------

Have a sense of purpose in life, develop the dispositions of adaptability and lifelong learning so as to be able to navigate education and career pathways purposefully and take on the challenges of the future, including the world of work and life; and

  

Active Citizenship
------------------

Develop a strong national identity based on a sense of belonging to the nation, a sense of hope in themselves and the future, an awareness of the reality of Singaporeâ€™s vulnerabilities and constraints, and the will to act on improving the lives of others, and building a future for our nation.

Character development is facilitated through daily interactions, as well as the different learning experiences. Explicit teaching of CCE values, attitudes, knowledge and skills equip our pupils with the ability to make responsible choices and become more aware of their roles in the society. During FTGP lessons, students are taught the social and emotional competencies (including Cyber Wellness and Education and Career Guidance and). CCE lessons are organised according to themes which reflect their life experiences. Students will be involved in different interesting activities and learn values through the lessons.
