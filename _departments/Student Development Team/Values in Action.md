VIA, an important component of BBPS’s CCE, are learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. Through VIA, we aim to help students internalise values learnt through real life experiential activities.

**Clean As You Go**

Pupils take clean the classrooms daily and this inculcates in responsibility in them to keep the place they study in clean. It also equips them with life skills and enforces the need to observe hygiene, health and safety.

  

The implementation of the grading system enables the students to know in which area they are doing well and guide them in the areas for improvement.

  

The habits learnt allow students to translate them to other observable cleaning acts within the school.
