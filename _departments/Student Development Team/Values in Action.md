<h4><strong>Values in Action: Nurturing Concerned Citizens and Future Leaders</strong></h4>
<p>At Bukit Panjang Primary School (BPPS), our Values in Action (VIA) programme,
which is part of MOE's Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) framework,
directly aligns with and supports our school's vision of developing concerned
citizens and future leaders who contribute meaningfully to the community.
Through VIA, students learn to be socially responsible and understand how
they can contribute to the community. This programme enables them to put
values into practice through hands-on experiences, helping them develop
empathy and a sense of responsibility to make a positive difference in
society. Our approach aligns with MOE's vision of nurturing students to
be active contributors and concerned citizens who are rooted to Singapore.</p>
<h4><strong>BPPS VIA Learning Approach</strong></h4>
<p>Students will learn and practice core values through:
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Age appropriate and sustained experiential
learning
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Progressive development from class, home, school
to community</p>

<p>This progressive approach ensures that:
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students develop leadership qualities
gradually and systematically
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each level builds upon previous
experiences
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students grow from caring for self
to caring for community
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leadership skills evolve from personal
responsibility to community leadership
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students become increasingly confident
in taking initiative and leading others</p>
