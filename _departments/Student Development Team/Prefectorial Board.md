The Prefectorial Board in BPPS consists of Primary 4 to Primary 6 students who are role models that embody the school values and possess strong student leadership. Our prefects not only serve the school but also the community.

  

The prefects are given opportunities to hone their leadership qualities by organising school events such as the Prefects’ Investiture, Teachers’ Day Celebration and Sports Carnival. The prefects also organised self-initiated VIA activities such as fund-raising for SPCA and interacting with the residents at Senja Home via Zoom.
