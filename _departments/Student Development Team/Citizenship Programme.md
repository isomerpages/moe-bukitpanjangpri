We aim to design learning experiences that strengthen our students’ citizenship dispositions to take collective ownership of our future as a nation.

  

**A Sense of Belonging**

To develop a deeper understanding of who we are, and a shared understanding of the values that are

important to us as a nation.

  

**A Sense of Reality**

To be aware of contemporary realities—including Singapore’s constraints and vulnerabilities—

which affect us as a nation amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world.

  

**A Sense of Hope**

To have confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.

(culminating in)

  

**The Will to Act**

To be active citizens who have a collective resolve and a sense of shared mission towards building a Singapore for all.

  

We strive to strengthen students’ citizenship dispositions through the following approaches:

  

**A) The four NE Commemorative Days:**

  

**Total Defence Day**

  

Total Defence Day (TDD) is commemorated annually on 15th February to mark Singapore's fall to the Japanese in 1942. This annual event seeks to remind us of the suffering endured by our fore fathers during the Japanese Occupation. It is also an occasion to remind us that the task of building and defending a nation is not easy, and that we must continue to work together to preserve our security, stability and prosperity. With the outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus, Total Defence is critical in bringing out the Singapore Spirit in us to stay resilient and united as we remind ourselves to stay calm in the face of adversity.

  

Singapore has remained safe and peaceful over the past 54 years because of all Singaporeans’ efforts in carrying out Total Defence. Students carried out online and classroom activities to commemorate Total Defence Day, and on 14th February, all students ate only sweet potato porridge during recess. This is to allow students to have a taste of what was typically eaten as meals during Japanese Occupation.

  

**International Friendship Day (IFD)**

  

IFD is a good opportunity for our students to be acquainted with the diverse and colourful cultures and traditions of the region and the lives of their peers in the other ASEAN countries and to keep an open mindset, and express an appreciation of the contributions of foreigners living, working and studying in Singapore

During COVID years, besides classroom activities to understand about the different ASEAN countries, we included information on how the ASEAN countries are affected by Covid-10 and what they did to help one another during this period of time.

  

**Racial Harmony Day**

  

RHD marks the anniversary of the 1964 racial riots. We commemorate RHD to celebrate Singapore as a harmonious society built on a rich diversity of cultures, requiring collaborative efforts from all to promote social cohesion and harmony.

  

Students learn about the significance of RHD through videos, classroom and online activities. For Primary 4 students, they learn how to promote racial harmony as Racial Harmony Ambassadors through the Orange Ribbon which is an initiative that works towards building harmony in Singapore. The Primary 5 and Primary 6 students also engage in dialogue on contemporary issues.

  

**National Day**

  

National Day marks our separation from Malaysia in 1965, and our emergence as an independent country in a community of nations. Every year, we hold the observance ceremony for students to have a greater sense of the historical importance and solemnity of National Day.

  

National Day is a rallying call to Singaporeans to play our part to push forward and determine Singapore’s future, in spite of the difficulties and crises. We held various classroom, school and online activities to commemorate National Day.

  

  

**B) NE infused in subjects** such as discussion of NE related topics in CCE MT, English, Social Studies etc.

  

**C) NE Infused in daily routines** e.g. students sing the National Anthem and recite the National Pledge to reinforce the values we stand for as a nation during Flag-Raising Ceremony as well as daily classroom

cleaning.

  

**D) Out-of-school learning experiences** that enable students to explore their personal and collective

Identity. These include both the core NE Learning Journeys, and cohort experiences such as level camps, and Pri 5 NE Show etc.
