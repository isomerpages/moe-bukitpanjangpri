In Bukit Panjang Primary School, we want our students, staff and parents to feel good, think good and do good. ‘Spotlight’ is a programme which aims to recognize students who do good. We have seen many students displaying positive behavior and we would want to encourage more students to be good role models.

  

**What kind of positive behaviour do teahcers look out for?**

1) Behaviours that are mentioned in the BPPS Behaviour Matrix (Page 12 & 13 of Student's Diary)

2) Behaviours that exhibit any of the 6 school values

3) Any positive behaviour

  

**Here are some of our students who were caught doing right!**
