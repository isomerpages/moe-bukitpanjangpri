Mentoring is a programme through which teachers engage students in intimate conversations every morning in a 1 to 1 setting, with the intent of building strong rapport with kids and to identify any concerns early. Having frequent and quality communication with our children an effective way of showing care and concern.

  

Using the ecological framework (ESPRiT), the teachers strive to understand every child better.
