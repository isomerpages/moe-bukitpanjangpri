Math is not about numbers, equations, computations or algorithms: it is about understanding concepts.Â The purpose of the Math Activity week is to make Math fun, interactive and engaging. This year, Math Activity Week is conducted online using the Student Learning Space (SLS) as a platform. The activities created for the Math Activity Week are integrated with the various topics and skills taught across Primary 1 to Primary 6. Students need to use the mathematical concepts which they have learnt. We also aim to incorporate authentic learning so that students are able to relate to Mathematics in their lives.
