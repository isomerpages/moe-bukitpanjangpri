Blended Learning is a combination of e-learning and in-school activities that tap on online and offline approaches to learning. While Full Home-Based Learning (FHBL) involves teachers teaching remotely and students learning at home over a period of time, Blended Learning involves students learning at home, through online resources and returning to school to have in-depth discussions and to seek clarification or help from teachers.

In 2021, BPPS introduced Blended Learning to our Primary 2 students. The teaching of carefully selected Mathematical concepts and skills was done through videos crafted by our teachers. The resources were uploaded to the Student Learning Space (SLS) online platform and students access the learning resources at home. Through this online package, students also get to pose questions and seek clarification from their teachers.

Upon returning to school, teachers would address questions and clarifications through meaningful discussions with students. They would also be engaged in collaborative learning activities to further strengthen and deepen their understanding on the Mathematical concept.

BPPS introduced Blended Learning to our Primary 2 students as we believe that this experience develop studentsâ€™ ability to be self-directed, passionate and life-long learners. It encourages students to take charge of their own learning as they learn at their own pace.
