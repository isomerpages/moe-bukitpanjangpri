Our Mathematics Department has invited Dr Yeap Ban Har to conduct a workshop for our teachers on “Problem-Solving Heuristics in Primary Mathematics” on Wednesday, 10 April. During the 3-hour session, he has demonstrated to our teachers how we can teach problem-solving using the 4 stages of instructional model. Classrooms settings have been staged so as to give our teachers the hands-on experience to apply the model.
