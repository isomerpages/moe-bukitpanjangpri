**LSM programme**

The Learning Support in Mathematics (LSM) programme is designed to provide early intervention for young learners in developing numeracy skills. Students in the programme are supported by trained LSM teachers to equip them with mathematical knowledge, skills and disposition.

The small class size allows students to receive extra support to attain the knowledge and numeracy skills required at their level. Through hands-on activities, students are motivated and engaged in their learning. Under the guidance of the teachers, they build confidence and cultivate interest in the learning of Mathematics.
