In BPPS, there are a variety of enrichment programmes and activities that develop students’ interests in Math.  

**E2K Mathematics Programme**

The E2K Mathematics Programme aims to develop students' mathematical reasoning skills and deepens their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.

Students will have opportunities to work independently or collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and mathematical explorations specially designed for this programme. The rich learning experiences offered by the programme serve to help students to:

*   Develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess.
*   Gain important 21st century competencies such as critical thinking, invention thinking and effective communication skills.

This programme is offered to selected students in Primary 4 and 5.

**Math Olympiad Training**

To expose students to different types of problem-solving skills, BPPS has engaged external vendors with certified instructors to prepare students for Math competitions, which test students beyond classroom topics.  The trainings are usually conducted in Semester 1 so as to equip students with the necessary skills to tackle the high-order questions in competitions.
