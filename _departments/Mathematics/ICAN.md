**Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)**

“All Students Can Learn”. That is the core belief of every Math teacher in BPPS. In collaboration with MOE, we embarked on the ICAN programme which aims to raise the confidence level of students and improve the overall performance of the low progress students from Primary 3 to 6. This programme targets 4 learning issues that students face – Learning gaps, weak command of the language, low motivation and poor memory retention. ICAN lessons follow the FREMC structure – Factual Fluency, Readiness, Engagement, Mastery and Consolidation.

Through this programme, selected teachers underwent intensive training and mentoring to equip themselves with the knowledge, skills and tools to deliver the intervention strategies. BPPS has also put in place necessary support structures to help such learners.
