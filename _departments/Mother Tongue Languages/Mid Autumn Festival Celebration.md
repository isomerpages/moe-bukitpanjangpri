This year, the Mid-Autumn Festival falls on 21 September.

The Mid-Autumn Festival has a long history, even with the change of times, it has always been a wonderful time for the Chinese to get together with their families, enjoy tasty moon cakes and the fragrance of nicely brewed tea and more importantly, enjoy the serenity of the night and the bright moon together.

Due to the current Covid-19 situation, like last year, celebrations for this festival in our school will go online and within the classroom setting. There will be pre-recorded videoclips presented by the Chinese teachers as well as the parents (tentatively). Apart from that, there will also be interesting classroom activities for each level.
