This project is inspired by the good work from our Tamil Language teachers in the department.

For each level, a Reading Package was prepared for students to bring home. The package consists of 5 short passages, and a simple rubric for parents to assess their childâ€™s reading skills.  The student will read to his/her parent every day. The parent can then provide feedback to the child using the given rubric.

This activity not only provides an opportunity for the child to practise reading aloud in Chinese, but also encourages meaningful parent-child interaction.
