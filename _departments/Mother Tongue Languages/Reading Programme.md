Reading is one of the most important paths of learning. It is essential in the formative aspect of primary education. Reading helps young children learn about the world and it slowly shapes their habits and attitudes towards life-long learning. Acquiring this skill can help children better understand things, and then gradually form positive attitudes and values.

  

There is a need to cultivate their reading skills and interests based on continuous accumulation and effort, not to depend merely on memorising information but to understand the essence of things through meaningful reading experience. Books are like windows leading to the world of wonders and splendidness, and reading is the key to opening these windows.

  

As our school will be celebrating 90th anniversary this year, we are embarking on a mother tongue story books reading marathon. From Term 2, we will be sharing a book list which consists of mother tongue story titles each term. We earnestly urge parents/guardians to encourage your child/ward to complete reading 90 books by the end of 2022 in celebration of BPPS 90th birthday.

  

Let’s start reading!
