The Mother Tongue Department has come up with various activities with the objective to promote reading culture and instill in students a love for reading. “Reading Marathon” has been launched since 2013, students are able to accumulate points from reading Chinese books and writing book reviews. Thereafter, the students can use their accumulated points to redeem prizes of their choice. Selected book reviews will also be put up on the noticeboard outside the canteen for all to view.

“New Stars Island” graded picture book series, published by Singapore Centre for Chinese Language, is also adopted as 1 of our reading activities. Every class from primary 1-6, has five sets of 6 different stories suitable for their level to borrow home to read. Subscription to eZhishi also ensures that our students have a total of 40 ebooks and 20 issues of Chinese magazine to read in a year. In addition, teachers will also bring students to our school library to borrow books on a fortnightly basis.

Picture book reading sessions are also conducted for P1-3 students. This not only arouses the students’ interest in reading, it also teaches students life lessons. Upper level class teachers will also loan students Chinese books suitable for the class from time to time to stretch their reading ability.

Story sharing sessions which were held twice a year for all P1-4 students to tell a story or act out a story on stage for the whole level to enjoy, has been moved online since last year so that more students are able to participate in this activity. Students can also rope in their family members to act out the story, providing more chances for family bonding. Many students and their family members have discovered the joy of reading through all these school activities.
