**Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES)**

 

An initiative by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), the Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) (“文化随意门”计划) aims to expose school students to Chinese language-related cultural performances by local and foreign performing arts groups, through providing schools with the necessary funding and support. The scheme hopes to allow students to enjoy Chinese culture in a relaxed manner.
