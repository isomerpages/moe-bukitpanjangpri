A new after school programme, Learning Chinese through the introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine, was conducted by the MTL department from February to April. In this programme, a group of 20 Primary 4 students learnt about famous TCM physicians, Chinese medicine and herbs, related idioms, basic acupuncture points and planted their own herbs. This programme is a collaboration between the Mother Tongue department and Parent Volunteers. It was conducted by a professional TCM physician who is also a parent volunteer. The students thoroughly enjoyed themselves and gained tremendous knowledge on TCM. The programme met the aim of sparking students' interest in learning Chinese language and culture.
