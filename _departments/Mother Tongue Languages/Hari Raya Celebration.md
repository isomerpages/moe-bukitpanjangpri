Hari Raya Aidilfitri refers to a day of celebration after fasting for a month. In Singapore and Malaysia, Hari Raya Aidilfitri is also known as Hari Raya Puasa. It also marks the start of the tenth month in the Muslim calendar, Syawal.

In the morning of Hari Raya Aidilfitri, men will go to the mosque to perform prayer while the other family members will be busy preparing the house to welcome guests or to visit their family and friends.

Preparation for Hari Raya Puasa is a family and community affair. The kampung spirit of gotong-royong or cooperation is still very much alive until today. In BPPS, we also cultivate the kampong spirit as everyone is involved in the preparation of our Hari Raya celebration on 17 May 2021 â€“ Mother Tongue teachers prepared the classroom activities resources, PSG helped with Hari Raya decoration, students and parents took photos of their Hari Raya preparation at home and submit to become a montage.

Although the usual Hari Raya concert cannot be held in the school hall, we still had a joyous Hari Raya celebration. Students got to watch pre-recorded performances by our own talented BPPS students, such as Malay Dance and Silat, followed by classroom activities including Hari Raya card-making, Paper Doll traditional costumes and creating Batik design.
