BPPS Happy Writing is an annual production by the MTL department which incorporate 3 mother tongue languages, Chinese, Malay and Tamil. It is a yearly compilation to showcase our studentsâ€™ creative thoughts and writing.

Good writing skills are fostered through active reading across different genres. Students who read widely are exposed to a wide variety of vocabulary, boundless ideas and different writing style.

We hope the readers can appreciate and enjoy reading the different style of writing by our creative young writers and may it inspire and motivate students to write well.
