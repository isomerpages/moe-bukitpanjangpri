BPPS celebrated Chinese New Year on 11 February. Everyone had a fun filled morning in school, learning about Chinese New Year through watching specially selected videos, followed by a quiz. The students also made Chinese New Year themed craft work and helped with spring cleaning of their classrooms.

Due to the Covid-19 safety management measures, we had our very own pre-recorded BPPS Chinese New Year concert this year and everyone watched it in class. It was entertaining and everyone enjoyed it even though we could not watch the performances live in the hall.

The celebration ended with live-streaming of the prize presentation for the Pre-CNY competitions for the various levels and our very first BPPS CNY Music Video. The students were excited to know the results of the competitions and thrilled to see themselves, their peers and all school staff in the music video.
