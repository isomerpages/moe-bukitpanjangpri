**Closure of school premise on 31st August**

Please note that the school will be used as a polling centre for the upcoming Presidential Election 2023. 

As such the school premise will be closed by 2pm on the 31st August in preparation for the election, and we regret that we will not be able to host the ex-students on that day.
