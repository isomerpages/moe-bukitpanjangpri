**Closure of school premise on 31st August**

Dear Ex-Students,

We would like to inform you of an important update regarding 31st August.

This year, our school has been selected as a polling centre for the upcoming Presidential Election, access to the school premises will be restricted on 31 August.

Unfortunately, this means that you will not be allowed to visit the school to meet with your former teachers. 

We kindly request your cooperation in adhering to this restriction.

We appreciate your kind understanding. Thank you for your cooperation.
